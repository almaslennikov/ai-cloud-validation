# Changelog backfill prompt

This prompt is invoked verbatim by `make changelog-fill` (via
`scripts/changelog-fill.sh`, which dispatches to `codex`, `claude`, or
`cursor-agent`). Edit it to tune output style/grouping; the target picks
up changes automatically.

You are filling in missing per-tag sections in `CHANGELOG.md` for the
NVIDIA AI Cloud Validation Suite repository.

## Goal

For every release version that is not yet documented in `CHANGELOG.md`,
add a complete `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section. Sections are kept in
**descending semver order**, so insert each one immediately above the
first existing `## [X.Y.Z]` heading whose version is lower than it (or at
the end of the file if there is no such heading). For a release cut from
`main` this is the top of the list. For an out-of-band patch release it
depends on the file: on the maintenance branch itself the new patch is
the newest section, but once that section is forward-ported to `main` it
belongs below the newer lines already documented there, not above them.
A version is considered a release if either:

1. There is a git tag of the form `vX.Y.Z` **that is reachable from `HEAD`**, OR
2. The `version` field of the root `pyproject.toml` is newer than the
   **nearest ancestor tag** (`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match "v*" --exclude "*-rc*"`)
   — this is a **pending release** that has been bumped but is not yet
   tagged (typically run as part of `make bump-*`). Compare against the
   ancestor tag rather than against every tag in the repo: on a
   `releases/X.Y.x` maintenance branch the pending patch version is older
   than the newest tag on `main`, and comparing globally would miss it
   entirely. See CONTRIBUTING.md, "Out-of-Band Releases".

Do not modify the file header, the "How to update this file" block, or
any version section that already has content.

## Steps

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` and list every `## [X.Y.Z]` heading already present.
2. Run `git tag --merged HEAD --sort=-v:refname` to list the release tags
   **reachable from the current branch**. Any tag of the form `vX.Y.Z` whose
   version is **not** already a heading in the file is missing.

   Use `--merged HEAD`, never a bare `git tag`. A bare listing returns every
   tag in the repository, including releases cut from other lines. On a
   `releases/X.Y.x` maintenance branch that would pull in the tags of every
   newer line — none of which are ancestors of this branch — and invent
   sections for work this branch does not contain. If a version is absent
   from `git tag --merged HEAD`, it is not a release of this branch: skip it,
   even when it is missing from `CHANGELOG.md` and looks like a gap.

   Also run `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match "v*" --exclude "*-rc*"`
   to get the nearest ancestor tag of `HEAD`, and read the root
   `pyproject.toml` — if its `version = "X.Y.Z"` is newer than that ancestor
   tag and not already a heading, treat it as a pending release.

   `--exclude "*-rc*"` matters because release candidates deliberately get no
   changelog section. If an ancestor lookup returned `vX.Y.Z-rcN`, the range
   would start at the candidate and the commits between the previous final
   release and that candidate would be documented nowhere.
3. For each missing version, in chronological order (oldest first):
   - For a **tagged release**, the commit range is `<prev_tag>..<tag>`, where
     `<prev_tag>` is the tag the release was cut from — use
     `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match "v*" --exclude "*-rc*" <tag>^`
     rather than "the previous tag by version number", so a patch cut from a
     maintenance branch is diffed against its own base and not against an
     unrelated tag on `main` (`git log --pretty='%H %s' <prev_tag>..<tag>`).
   - For a **pending release**, the commit range is `<ancestor_tag>..HEAD`
     (`git log --pretty='%H %s' <ancestor_tag>..HEAD`), using the nearest
     ancestor tag from step 2. Skip the bump commit itself
     (`chore: update package versions to X.Y.Z`).
   - Each commit subject ends with the PR number in parentheses, e.g.
     `(#425)`. Fetch the PR for richer context from
     `https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/pull/<N>` (use the
     `gh pr view <N>` CLI if available, otherwise an HTTP fetch). If the PR
     is inaccessible, fall back to reading the commit itself with
     `git show <hash>`.
   - For each PR, write a professional-grade description (one sentence;
     add a second only if genuinely needed) that helps consumers of the
     repo understand what changed and why. Avoid implementation jargon
     when a behavior description is clearer.
4. Pick the section date:
   - For a **tagged release**: the tag's commit date,
     `git log -1 --format=%ad --date=short <tag>`.
   - For a **pending release**: today's date (UTC or local, your choice).

## Format

Group bullets by intent using these subsections, in this order (omit any
that are empty):

- `### Added` — new validations, providers, CLI commands, config options
  (`feat:` commits that introduce something new).
- `### Changed` — behavior or output changes downstream consumers may
  notice (`feat:` or `refactor:` commits that alter existing behavior).
- `### Fixed` — bug fixes worth calling out (`fix:` commits).
- `### Removed` — removed or deprecated functionality.
- `### Internal` — refactors, docs, tests, CI, and other non-user-facing
  changes (`refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:` commits).

### Bullet style by section

For **Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed**, use a two-line
bullet with a bold title, a linked PR reference, and a one-sentence
description (a second sentence only if genuinely needed) indented two
spaces under the title:

```md
- **Concise title summarizing the change** ([#N](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/pull/N))
  One sentence explaining what changed and why (add a second only if
  genuinely needed). Describe the user-visible behavior — not the
  implementation — and reference the relevant validation ID, CLI flag,
  config key, or provider when useful.
```

For **Internal**, use a terse one-line form with a linked PR ref (no
bold title, no description paragraph):

```md
- Brief description ([#N](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/pull/N)).
```

### Roll-up entries

When several PRs are clearly part of one initiative (e.g. a sweeping
refactor or a multi-PR feature series), collapse them into a single
bullet with all PR refs inline and one shared description:

```md
- **Common theme across the series** ([#A](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/pull/A), [#B](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/pull/B), [#C](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/pull/C))
  One description that covers the whole series. Prefer this over three
  near-identical separate bullets.
```

### Always

- Skip the version-bump commit itself
  (`chore: update package versions to X.Y.Z`).
- Omit purely cosmetic chores (SPDX-header updates, lint-only changes,
  dependency lock-file refreshes) unless they have user-visible impact.
- If a commit has no PR (initial commit, direct push), omit the
  parenthetical entirely rather than inventing one.

## When done

Edit `CHANGELOG.md` in place and print a one-line summary of which tags
were added, e.g. `Added 3 sections: 0.6.7, 0.6.8, 0.7.0`. The maintainer
will review the diff before committing.
