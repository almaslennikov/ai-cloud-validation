# Kubernetes Launch Kit provider internals

This directory owns the implementation behind
`config/provider.yaml`. It is provider-specific code, not a cross-provider
helper.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config/provider.yaml` | Generic single-workflow provider using real `l8k` and `kubectl` by default |
| `config/network-operator.yaml` | Production six-use-case Network Operator workflow |
| `scripts/adapter.py` | Transport for install/verify, Kubernetes preflight, and one `l8k` workflow command |

Test doubles and pinned scenario data intentionally live outside the shipped
provider under `isvctl/tests/providers/k8s_launch_kit/fixtures/`. The provider
tests load the production YAML and inject those paths in memory.

The adapter must remain thin. It accepts raw argument arrays for `discover`,
`generate`, `deploy`, `validate`, and `clean`, appends `--output json`, executes the
configured `l8k` executable, and preserves the CLI's JSON documents without
renaming or interpreting fields. The one file-level input is `user_config`, a
path to a complete Launch Kit configuration. Before discovery, the adapter
copies it to the workflow as `user-config.yaml` and explicitly writes the
discovered result to `cluster-config.yaml`; the original is never modified.
Launch Kit still owns the file schema, domain flags, and defaults. Semantic
assertions belong in `isvtest.validations.k8s_launch_kit`.

Launch Kit `validate` steps use `timeout: null` so the CLI owns its deadline.
l8k calculates and logs a bounded matrix budget by default and honors a user's
explicit `--connectivity-timeout`. The remaining workflow steps keep finite
isvctl watchdogs. Other providers may also use `timeout: null`, but only when
their child command has its own bounded timeout.

The grouped Network Operator workflow passes only its fabric and deployment
identity during discovery. With no `user_config`, Launch Kit resolves the
default `./cluster-config.yaml` and `./deployment` paths throughout the
workflow. With `user_config`, every selected use case stages an independent
copy, and the adapter owns `--user-config` plus `--save-cluster-config` for
discovery. Do not repeat either flag in the raw discovery argument array.

Each `clean` step is declared in `phase: teardown` and linked to its matching
`deploy` step with `finalizer_for`. During a normal or `--phase test` run, the
orchestrator executes it directly after that use case's validations and reports
an explicit `<use-case>-teardown` phase. It runs whenever deployment actually
started, including after a failed deploy or validate. It is not activated when
preflight, discovery, generation, template rendering, or process startup stops
the workflow before deployment. Cleanup failures block later use cases even
though ordinary use-case failures may continue. An explicit `--phase teardown`
run invokes the selected clean steps as a standalone recovery workflow.

Each workflow envelope records the absolute working directory while retaining
Launch Kit's JSON documents unchanged. Validations use that metadata to resolve
relative `generatedFiles` paths emitted by the CLI.

Install mode delegates archive selection and checksum handling to Launch Kit's
official `scripts/install.sh`, then verifies the binary at the install prefix.
When the user pins `installation.version`, both setup and test-phase
verification require `l8k version --output json` to report that exact version.
The captured schema must advertise all five workflow commands, including
`clean`, so an older binary is rejected before deployment.

The preflight uses the same explicit kubeconfig and forwarded environment as
the Launch Kit workflow. It rejects conflicting `--kubeconfig` arguments and
requires Kubernetes API access plus at least one Ready node before a normal
use case can mutate the cluster. Teardown-only recovery invokes `clean`
directly so cleanup remains available when test prerequisites do not pass.

The same string-only environment mapping is also passed to the installer and
version/schema verification, so proxy and executable runtime settings do not
change between setup and test phases.

The production adapter executes `executable` directly. There is no Python-file
special case: a test double must be an executable with a valid shebang, just
like any other CLI implementation. This keeps mock behavior out of the public
provider contract.

See the [integration guide](../../../../docs/guides/k8s-launch-kit/network-operator.md)
for configuration, use cases, evidence, prerequisites, and current production
gaps.
