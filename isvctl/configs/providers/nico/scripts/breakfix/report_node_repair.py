"""Report a node to the provider for maintenance and observe the repair state (BFX01-06).

BFX01-06 is the non-destructive half of the break-fix lifecycle: "this node needs
repair eventually, but I am still using it". The tenant keeps the node and its
workload; only the provider's view of the node changes. Relinquishing the node so
the provider can drain and repair it is the destructive counterpart, BFX01-02.

The mechanism is NICo's *online repair*: a privileged tenant reports a
``healthIssue`` against a machine, NICo applies a site health override and moves
the assigned instance from ``Ready`` to ``Repairing``, and clearing online repair
takes it back out again. The instance keeps its tenant assignment throughout, so
the round trip is reversible -- unlike release-for-repair (``DELETE instance``
with ``machineHealthIssue``), which hands the node back.

The report is deliberately node-scoped rather than component-scoped. A tenant may
well be reporting a bad GPU, but NICo manages machines, not GPUs, and its own
online-repair documentation treats a GPU fault as something a tenant *reports*
against the node. So there is one report path for any hardware complaint.

Online repair requires a machine with an assigned instance in ``Ready``. A site
with no such machine emits a structured skip rather than a failure: nothing is
broken, the precondition simply is not met.

NICo API endpoints used (the ``/carbide/`` segment is the current deployed name
for what newer docs call ``/nico/``; the other NICo scripts use it too):
  GET   /{org}/carbide/machine?siteId={site_id}
  GET   /{org}/carbide/instance/{instance_id}
  PATCH /{org}/carbide/machine/{machine_id}   (operationId update-machine)

Auth:
  - NICO_BEARER_TOKEN, or OIDC client_credentials
    (NICO_SSA_ISSUER / NICO_CLIENT_ID / NICO_CLIENT_SECRET).
  - Requires provider admin, or a tenant admin whose tenant has the
    ``TargetedInstanceCreation`` capability. NICo rejects anyone else with 403.

Mutating requires the operator to opt in. A shared site's only eligible machine may
belong to another tenant, so an auto-discovered target is reported in a structured
skip rather than moved into repair -- which also makes a plain run a dry run. Confirm
with ``--machine-id <id>``, or set ``NICO_ALLOW_ONLINE_REPAIR=1`` to accept whichever
eligible node is found.

Entering online repair requires acknowledging data-corruption and repair-team-access
risk; those acknowledgements are NICo's required contract, not a choice this step
makes. ``allowAutoInstanceDeletionOnFailure`` is pinned ``false`` so NICo never
deletes the tenant's instance on our behalf.

Online repair is cleared in a ``finally``, so the node cannot be left in
``Repairing`` even when the teardown phase never runs. See ``_restore`` for how far
that goes and why -- a node stranded out of the allocatable pool is the worst
outcome this step can produce. The clear runs whenever the enter request *may* have
been applied, not only when NICo confirmed it: a PATCH that timed out on the read
can still have enabled online repair. See ``_enter_may_have_applied``.

``--skip-restore`` leaves the node in repair for debugging; recover with
``PATCH machine`` ``{"onlineRepair": {"enabled": false}}``, or
``DELETE /machine/{id}/health-report/request-online-repair``.

The JSON contract is ``operation.{requested, repair_state_observed, restored,
node_id, message}``, documented alongside the other break-fix steps in
``isvctl/configs/suites/README.md`` and asserted by ``ReportNodeRepairCheck``.

Usage:
    NICO_BEARER_TOKEN=<token> \
        python report_node_repair.py --org <org> --site-id <uuid> --api-base <url>

    Wired via the bare_metal suite:
      uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/nico/config/bare_metal.yaml
