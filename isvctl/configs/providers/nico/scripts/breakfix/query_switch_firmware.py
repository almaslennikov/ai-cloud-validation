"""Inspect NV switch tray firmware versions through the NICo API (BFX03-02).

NICo models switch trays as a first-class resource carrying a firmware version,
so the inspection is a plain read: list the site's trays and report each one's
version. No BMC, no vendor tooling, no command execution on the hardware.

**BFX03-02 is only half satisfied, and deliberately so.** ``get-all-tray`` is
``PROVIDER_ADMIN``-scoped, while the requirement asks for something a *tenant*
can inspect. Three answers are possible and each means something different:

  - Provider credentials on a Flow site: the firmware versions come back and the
    check passes. That is the "better than nothing" half -- it proves NICo holds
    the data and exposes it, so the remaining work is authorisation rather than
    plumbing.
  - Tenant credentials: NICo answers 403, and that is *the finding*, not a
    failure of this step. A structured skip names the gap, so a
    tenant-perspective run reports "not available to a tenant", not "broken".
  - A site whose REST record has ``Site.capabilities.flow`` off: NICo answers
    412 and there is no tray inventory at all. Also a skip, but a different
    fact -- the capability is absent from the site rather than withheld from
    the caller. That REST flag is provider-settable via ``PATCH /site/{id}``
    and is independent of NICo Core's ``rack_management_enabled``, which
    ``/admin`` shows and which does not gate this endpoint. Confusing the two
    would report a lab-configuration detail as a provider gap.

A run therefore cannot tell you the tenant half works, only whether the
provider half does. Nothing here escalates privilege to paper over that.

NICo API endpoints used (the ``/carbide/`` segment is the current deployed name
for what newer docs call ``/nico/``; the other NICo scripts use it too):
  GET /{org}/carbide/tray?siteId={site_id}&type=NVSwitch          (operationId get-all-tray)
  GET /{org}/carbide/expected-switch?siteId={site_id}            (412 path only; declared hardware)

``type=NVSwitch`` matters: a tray is any rack component, so an unfiltered list
also returns ``Compute`` and ``PowerShelf`` trays. BFX03-02 asks about switch
firmware, and demanding a firmware version from a power shelf would fail the
provider for a question nobody asked.

The response is a bare JSON array of ``Tray``, not a wrapped collection, so no
result key is passed. Identity comes from ``id``, falling back to
``componentId`` then ``name``; the version is ``firmwareVersion``. All are real
fields on the documented schema, and only ``nvLinkDomainId``/``taskStats`` are
marked required there, hence the fallbacks for identity.

Auth:
  - NICO_BEARER_TOKEN, or OIDC client_credentials
    (NICO_SSA_ISSUER / NICO_CLIENT_ID / NICO_CLIENT_SECRET).
  - The spec is explicit: the org must have an Infrastructure Provider entity
    and the caller needs a ``PROVIDER_ADMIN``-suffixed role. Anything less is
    the documented gap, not a fault.

The JSON contract is ``trays[].{tray_id, firmware_version}``, documented
alongside the other break-fix steps in ``isvctl/configs/suites/README.md`` and
asserted by ``NvSwitchFirmwareCheck``.

Usage:
    NICO_BEARER_TOKEN=<token> \
        python query_switch_firmware.py --org <org> --site-id <uuid> --api-base <url>
