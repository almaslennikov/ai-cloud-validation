"""Read-only reference implementation of the BFX04-01 node-health-agent query.

Reports, per configured GPU node, whether a GPU health monitoring process is
running, and names the one it found. Evidence comes from ``systemctl is-active``
over SSH, so it works on any bare-metal fleet whose control-plane API does not
expose agent state.

BFX04-01 itself names no product -- the requirement is that *something* is
watching GPU health -- so the unit list below is this reference's answer to
"which processes count here", not the requirement's. A fleet running a different
agent names its own units through ``--units`` rather than editing this shared
script or failing the check.

Nodes are named through ``--nodes``. With none configured the step emits a
structured skip: an unconfigured site is indistinguishable from one with no
agents, and a pass there would assert nothing.

``--expected-nodes`` is how a short list stops being a quiet pass. The probe
judges the nodes it is given, so naming three of a site's sixty-four would
otherwise carry BFX04-01 for the whole site. The fleet size is therefore
declared separately -- ideally from the provider's own inventory rather than by
hand -- and the check fails when the records do not cover it. Deriving it in
YAML has one trap worth knowing: an aggregate like ``| length`` over a step that
never ran renders ``0`` rather than empty, so the orchestrator's missing-step
guard does not fire. A zero is rejected below instead, which turns that into a
loud failure rather than a fleet of nobody that everything covers.

Probes fan out across nodes because they are dominated by SSH round-trip
latency. A serial probe of a full rack would outlive the step timeout and the
executor would kill the process before it could emit its JSON contract.

Fanning out bounds the wall time but does not cap it: an unreachable fleet costs
``ceil(nodes / MAX_CONCURRENT_PROBES) * PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``, which on a large
enough fleet still outruns the step timeout. So the sweep also has its own
deadline, set below that timeout, and stops when it expires. Whatever remains
unprobed fails the step by name -- a diagnosis the orchestrator cannot give,
because killing the process discards stdout and with it the JSON contract.
