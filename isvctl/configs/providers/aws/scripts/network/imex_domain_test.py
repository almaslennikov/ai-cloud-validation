"""IMEX domain connectivity test - AWS reference implementation (SDN21-01).

Bringing an IMEX domain up (writing nodes_config.cfg, starting the
`nvidia-imex` service) is a cluster-lifecycle concern owned elsewhere (see
NVIDIA Mission Control autonomous-hardware-recovery's `imex_bring_up.sh`
action) - out of scope per the requirement ("service lifecycle management").
This script only observes an ALREADY-RUNNING domain: it SSHes into each
expected member node and asks `nvidia-imex-ctl -N` what that node currently
sees, then reports each node's raw view. It never aggregates a single
"fully connected" verdict itself - ImexDomainConnectivityCheck computes
pairwise connectivity independently from the raw `reachability` map so a
one-way fault is never masked by an aggregate flag.

Nodes are GPU hosts (multi-node NVLink domain, e.g. P5/P4d instance family)
that must already be provisioned and IMEX-enabled; this script does not
launch or provision them (unlike dhcp_ip_test.py's throwaway t3.micro),
since real GPU capacity is not something a per-test script should launch on
demand. Point it at an existing cluster via --node-ids (SSH-reachable
hostnames or IPs) and --key-file, or the AWS_IMEX_* env var equivalents,
mirroring the "reuse an existing instance" dev workflow documented in
bare_metal.yaml.

`nvidia-imex-ctl -N -j` (JSON output; confirmed against a live single-node
UP domain and a live 2-node DOWN domain on 2026-09-04) returns one entry per
CONFIGURED member (not just the queried node), each with its own
"connections" map, e.g.:
    {
      "nodes": {
        "0": {
          "status": "READY",
          "host": "10.0.0.1",
          "hostName": "gpu-node-1",
          "connections": {
            "0": {"host": "10.0.0.1", "status": "CONNECTED", "changed": true},
            "1": {"host": "10.0.0.2", "status": "CONNECTED", "changed": true}
          },
          "changed": true,
          "version": "580.95.05"
        },
        "1": { "status": "UNAVAILABLE", "host": "10.0.0.2", "connections": {...}, ... }
      },
      "timestamp": "9/4/2026 00:37:39.905",
      "status": "UP"
    }
Peer entries (status "UNAVAILABLE", "connections" all "INVALID") appear to be
reconstructed from nodes_config.cfg rather than a live report from that peer,
so `_parse_imex_ctl_json` only reads the entry matching the node we actually
SSHed into - that is what keeps `reachability[node]` an independent
per-node observation rather than one node's possibly-stale view of everyone
else. `nvidia-imex-ctl` exits 255 (confirmed live) when it cannot read its
node config, so a non-zero exit reliably means "this node has no usable
view" - it is excluded from `members` entirely rather than reported with an
empty/misleading reachability list. Confirmed live too: the daemon can also
fail to *start* on a version-mismatched host ("NvGpu Library version ... is
not matching with current GPU driver version") - `-N` then reports domain
status "DOWN" with every configured member "UNAVAILABLE", which flows
through the same non-READY/no-CONNECTED-peers path as any other outage.

The expected member set comes from configuration membership (--node-ids /
AWS_IMEX_NODE_IDS), i.e. the operator states which nodes were allocated to the
domain. Those IDs must match the identity form written into nodes_config.cfg.

Usage:
    python imex_domain_test.py --region us-west-2 \\
        --node-ids gpu-node-1.cluster.internal,gpu-node-2.cluster.internal \\
        --key-file /tmp/isv-imex-test-key.pem

Emits the SDN21-01 step output contract (see output_schemas.py "imex_domain"):
    {
      "success": true,
      "platform": "network",
      "domain": {
        "domain_id": "...", "state": "up",
        "expected_members": ["node-01", "node-02"],
        "fully_connected": true
      },
      "nodes_checked": 2,
      "nodes_validated": 2,
      "nodes": [
        {"node_id": "node-01", "service_state": "active",
         "domain_member": true, "peers_reachable": ["node-02"]}
      ]
    }
``domain.fully_connected`` is the vendor's own aggregate claim, reported for
context only - ImexDomainConnectivityCheck ignores it and recomputes pairwise
connectivity from each node's ``peers_reachable``.

    ``own_status`` is the queried node's own entry status ("READY" when its IMEX
    service is up and participating, "UNAVAILABLE" when it is not), which the
    caller maps onto the contract's ``service_state`` / ``domain_member``.

    Confirmed live (2026-09-04, 2-node cluster): `nodes` contains an entry for
    EVERY configured member, not just the queried one - including entries for
    peers whose own daemon is down (e.g. "status": "UNAVAILABLE", "connections"
    all "INVALID"), which appear to be reconstructed from nodes_config.cfg
    rather than a live report from that peer. So we deliberately use only the
    entry matching `queried_host`'s own connections map as this node's
    observation, rather than any other entry in the payload - that is what
    keeps `reachability[node]` an independent, per-node observation instead of
    the daemon's possibly-stale view of everyone else.

    `queried_host` is whatever identity form --node-ids used (IP or hostname).
    `nvidia-imex-ctl` always reports the IP in "host" and (with -H) the
    hostname in "hostName", but each `connections` entry only carries "host"
    (IP) - so a hostname-configured domain would otherwise (a) never match
    `queried_host` against "host", finding no "own" entry at all, and (b)
    even if it did, report peers as IPs that don't match the caller's
    hostname-based `expected_members`, silently producing zero peers. Both
    are fixed by matching "own" against either field, then translating each
    peer's IP back to the same identity form `queried_host` used - built from
    every node's host/hostName pair, since a peer's own top-level entry
    carries both even when its `connections` sub-entry only has the IP.
