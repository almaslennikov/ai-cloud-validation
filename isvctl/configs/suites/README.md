# Validation Contracts

Provider-agnostic validation contracts. Each YAML defines *what* to
validate (checks, expected fields, thresholds) but not *how* to run it.
[Provider configs](../providers/) import these files and supply the
commands (steps + scripts) that produce JSON for the validations to check.

- **Adding your own platform?** Start at the [my-isv scaffold](../providers/my-isv/scripts/README.md).
- **New to the framework?** See the [External Validation Guide](../../../docs/guides/external-validation-guide.md).
- **Try it without cloud credentials:** `make demo-test`.

## What runs, and when

A **platform suite** (`tests.capability: <capability>` — `vm`, `bare_metal`,
`kubernetes`, `slurm`) is the obligation attached to declaring that capability. Its checks
declare no `requires:`; they all run.

A **plain suite** (everything else — `storage`, `network`, ...) mixes checks
that need no infrastructure with checks that do. Each declares what it
presupposes:

```yaml
requires: []                # core - runs in every context
requires: [kubernetes]      # runs only under --capability kubernetes
requires: [vm, bare_metal]  # any-match: either context satisfies it
```

One rule decides what runs, and it does not depend on how you named the
config — `--suite`, `-f`, and `--label` discovery all behave identically:

> **A plain suite with no `--capability` runs its core checks.** Name a
> capability to add the checks gated on it.

```bash
isvctl test run --provider aws --suite storage                        # core only
isvctl test run --provider aws --suite storage --capability vm        # core + vm checks
```

There is no "run everything" context: no ISV runs on `vm` and `kubernetes`
at once, so a run always carries exactly one context. Steps follow the same
rule — give a step `requires:` when it builds or tears down a fixture only
some contexts need, so a core run neither provisions nor leaks it.

## Running against a system that is already up

A canonical suite can be run directly with `--suite` (or `-f`), against a
cluster you already have and with no provider selected. Whether any lifecycle
runs depends on the file: a suite that declares no `commands:` runs its test
phase only, and one that declares them supplies a scaffold fixture that reports
on the current system rather than provisioning anything. For example, run
selected Kubernetes storage probes against the cluster `KUBECTL` selects:

```bash
ISVTEST_INCLUDE_UNRELEASED=1 uv run isvctl test run --suite storage \
  --capability kubernetes -- \
  -k "K8sNfsMountOptionsCheck or K8sCsiStorageTypesCheck"
```

`storage` gets its StorageClass names from its `setup_cluster` fixture, which
reports the classes already installed on the cluster. Set `K8S_CSI_BLOCK_SC`,
`K8S_CSI_SHARED_FS_SC`, or `K8S_CSI_NFS_SC` to name them yourself, and add
`--phase test` to skip the fixture entirely. Checks bound to provider-produced
step output still skip as `step_not_configured` when their provider is absent.
The equivalent explicit-file form is
`-f isvctl/configs/suites/storage.yaml`.

Suites:
[`iam`](iam.yaml),
[`network`](network.yaml),
[`vm`](vm.yaml),
[`bare_metal`](bare_metal.yaml),
[`storage`](storage.yaml),
[`observability`](observability.yaml),
[`k8s`](k8s.yaml),
[`slurm`](slurm.yaml),
[`control-plane`](control-plane.yaml),
[`image-registry`](image-registry.yaml),
[`security`](security.yaml),
[`network-operator`](k8s-launch-kit/network-operator.yaml).
The Network Operator Launch Kit integration is unreleased; see the
[Launch Kit integration guide](../../../docs/guides/k8s-launch-kit/network-operator.md)
before running its cluster-mutating workflows.

[my-isv scaffold README](../providers/my-isv/scripts/README.md#domains).

## Naming a check

A wiring name is the test's identity everywhere downstream — the catalog, the
report, the service — so it has to be globally unique and say what it proves.
Wiring a generic check under its class name spends that identity on the
implementation instead, and repeating it produces several rows all called
`StepSuccessCheck`. Name the property under test and list the generic checks
that establish it:

```yaml
    setup_checks:
      step: create_user
      checks:
        IamUserCreatedCheck:
          test_id: "IAM01-01"
          labels: ["iam"]
          requires: []
          description: "Check the IAM user is created with usable credentials"
          compose:
            - StepSuccessCheck
            - FieldExistsCheck:
                fields: ["username", "access_key_id"]
```

That is one catalog entry carrying one `test_id`, and one test. Every member
runs against the group's step output as a subtest, so a failure still names the
part that broke, and every member runs even after an earlier one fails. A member
that needs parameters takes them inline (`- CheckName: {...}`); one that does
not stays a single line.

If a member reports its own subtests, the composite forwards them as
`MemberName/probe-name`. Successful parents are summarized automatically by
subtest count in `isvctl` output; failures retain their complete diagnostic
message. This is shared renderer behavior, not a suite option.

Because a composite has no validation class to borrow from, it declares its own
`description` (the catalog uses it) and its name must not shadow a class name. A
check that wires one purpose-built class — `SerialConsoleCheck`,
`IamCredentialAccessCheck` — already has a name that says what it proves and
keeps it.

The generic checks — `StepSuccessCheck`, `FieldExistsCheck`, `FieldValueCheck`,
`CrudOperationsCheck` — are marked `compose_only` in their class definition and a
suite may only reach them from inside a `compose` list. Suffixing the class name
(`StepSuccessCheck-teardown`) does not count: it still leaves the mechanism, not
the property under test, as the test's public identity.

### Prefixes

A `Bm`/`Vm` prefix means the check asserts a property of one bare-metal host or
one VM, so the same property can be proven for both without the two names
colliding: `BmGpusPresentCheck` and `VmGpusPresentCheck`, `BmCloudInitCheck` and
`VmCloudInitCheck`. The prefix follows the subject, not the suite and not the
`test_id`'s requirement family — `BmHardwareSerialCheck` proves BFX03-01 and
`BmCloudInitCheck` proves BOOT02-01, and both are still properties of a host.

A check that asserts something about the platform, the fabric, or a service
stays unprefixed even when it is wired into `bare_metal.yaml`, because there is
no per-host reading of it to distinguish: `GovernanceMetricsCheck` (fleet-wide
counts), `HealthAggregationCheck` (cluster/nodegroup/reservation level),
`IbTenantIsolationCheck` (fabric), `StableStorageNodeIpCheck` (storage service).
Those live here because that is where the provider supplying the step imports
from; several already carry a `network` or `sds_controller` label for the same
reason. Prefixing them would claim a scope their plan items do not have.

Three more stay unprefixed for narrower reasons.
`VirtualDeviceHardeningCheck` (CNP01-17) already names its subject and has no
bare-metal reading. `HostHealthCheck` (CAP05-01) is the per-host half of a pair
whose other half is fleet-level, and prefixing one half would hide that they are
one requirement at two scopes. `SerialConsoleRetentionCheck` (CNP06-02) is a
property of the console archive rather than of the host, and unlike CNP06-01/03
its plan item is not platform-scoped.

### Network Operator (`k8s-launch-kit/network-operator.yaml`)

Plain suite for Kubernetes Launch Kit Network Operator self-validation. The
generic provider in `providers/k8s-launch-kit/config/provider.yaml` mirrors the real CLI as
separate verify, prerequisite, discover, generate, deploy, and validate steps.
It forwards user-supplied argument arrays and does not own Network Operator,
profile, topology, resource, or validation defaults. The suite binds fifteen
checks (one prerequisite plus fourteen currently supported PRD areas) directly
to the command output that proves them.

GPUDirect RDMA is registered from Launch Kit's `gpudirect_dmabuf` result family;
the check skips when that family is disabled or not selected and fails on
emitted GPU topology or bandwidth errors. State restoration remains deferred
until Launch Kit provides the required snapshot/restore/verify workflow.

The same suite reuses those global check classes in six separate composite
tests: RoCE and InfiniBand across SR-IOV, RDMA Shared, and host-device
deployment modes. Keeping both forms in one file exposes one frontend suite,
`network_operator`, rather than a second implementation-detail suite. Each
composite includes only checks applicable to that use case, so unrelated
fabric/deployment checks do not appear as skips in the middle of a run. The
Ethernet/RoCE composites carry `ethernet` and `roce`; the InfiniBand composites
carry `infiniband`. All six also carry `gpudirect` because Launch Kit discovery
decides whether the GPUDirect family is applicable.

`providers/k8s-launch-kit/config/network-operator.yaml` is the production
entrypoint. It uses `l8k` and `kubectl` from `PATH` by default. In one invocation
it runs `launch_kit_prepare` in `setup`, `launch_kit_verify` in
`launch-kit-verification`, then executes the six use-case phases sequentially,
each with its own preflight, discover, generate, validate, and evidence
directories. The phases are
independent, so a failed case records a failed overall run but does not prevent
later cases from producing results. Mock executables exist only under
`isvctl/tests/providers/k8s_launch_kit/fixtures/` and are injected by tests.

```bash
ISVTEST_INCLUDE_UNRELEASED=1 uv run isvctl test run \
  -f isvctl/configs/providers/k8s-launch-kit/config/network-operator.yaml \
  --capability kubernetes --no-upload -- -v
```

Add `--label ethernet` or `--label infiniband` before `--no-upload` to run only
that fabric's three workflows. Their steps use
`requires_selected_validations`, so the other fabric's mutating commands are
pruned before execution. Use `--label sriov`, `--label rdma_shared`, or
`--label host_device` to run the matching two-fabric deployment mode. Labels
compose, so `--label ethernet --label sriov` selects one use case. Omitting
labels runs all six.

| Step | Phase | Script | Key JSON Fields |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `launch_kit_prepare` | setup | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py prepare` | `installed`, `executable`, `checks.{version,schema}`, `artifacts` |
| `launch_kit_verify` | test | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py verify` | `executable`, `checks.{version,schema}`, `artifacts` |
| `launch_kit_kubernetes_preflight` | test | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py preflight` | `server_version`, `node_count`, `ready_node_count`, `checks`, `artifacts` |
| `launch_kit_discover` | test | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py run` -> `l8k discover` | raw `documents`, `argv`, `exit_code`, `artifacts` |
| `launch_kit_generate` | test | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py run` -> `l8k generate` | raw `documents`, `argv`, `exit_code`, `artifacts` |
| `launch_kit_deploy` | test | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py run` -> `l8k deploy` | raw `documents` (currently empty on success), `argv`, `exit_code`, `artifacts` |
| `launch_kit_validate` | test | `providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py run` -> `l8k validate` | raw static, connectivity, and report-path `documents`, `argv`, `exit_code`, `artifacts` |

Those are the generic provider's single-workflow names. The grouped production
configuration performs prepare in `setup` and verify in
`launch-kit-verification`, then repeats preflight, discover, generate, and
validate under each custom use-case phase with names such as
`launch_kit_roce_sriov_preflight` through
`launch_kit_roce_sriov_validate`.

| `query_repair_history` | test | `providers/nico/scripts/breakfix/query_repair_history.py` | `history_queryable`, `records[].{machine_id,entries}` -- a record needs non-empty `entries` to count (BFX02-03) |
| `query_switch_firmware` | test | `providers/nico/scripts/breakfix/query_switch_firmware.py` | `trays[].{tray_id,firmware_version}` -- reads `Tray.firmwareVersion`; `get-all-tray` is `PROVIDER_ADMIN`-only, so tenant credentials skip naming the gap rather than failing (BFX03-02) |
| `query_bmc_kernel_logs` | test | `providers/nico/scripts/breakfix/query_bmc_kernel_logs.py` | `hosts[].{host_id,window_start,window_end,entries_returned}` -- a windowed query that returns entries, not a "logs available" boolean (BFX03-03) |
| `report_node_repair` | test | `providers/nico/scripts/breakfix/report_node_repair.py` | `operation.{requested,repair_state_observed,restored,node_id}` -- reports a node as needing repair while keeping it, and watches the node enter a repair state (BFX01-06) |
| `return_node_maintenance` | test | `providers/nico/scripts/breakfix/return_node_maintenance.py` | `operation.{requested,accepted,instance_deleted,machine_quarantined,instance_id,machine_id}` -- relinquishes the instance and verifies the machine is held for repair rather than returned to the pool; irreversible, so it skips unless an instance is named *and* `NICO_ALLOW_RELEASE_FOR_REPAIR=1` (BFX01-02) |

Any name is accepted, but a `running` record must supply one; the check matches no specific product, and a fleet running another agent names its units with `--units` rather than editing the shared script. List every GPU node, marking uncovered ones `running: false` rather than omitting them; `nodes_expected` is the platform's GPU node count and must come from inventory rather than from the list itself, since the check fails when the records do not cover it; skip when no GPU nodes are configured (BFX04-01) |
| `query_planned_notifications` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/breakfix/query_planned_notifications.py` | `notification_channel_observable`, `notifications[].{machine_id,type,message,notified_at,window_start}` -- `notified_at` must precede `window_start` (the lead time) (BFX05-01) |
| `query_failure_notifications` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/breakfix/query_failure_notifications.py` | `notification_channel_observable`, `notifications[].{machine_id,type,message,detected_at,notified_at}` -- `detected_at` to `notified_at` is the latency (BFX06-01) |

### Storage (`storage.yaml`)

Umbrella suite for the storage capability area. Today it covers persistent block
storage (DATASVC-XX-02/03/04); future object/file storage checks land here too rather
than spawning new suites. A shared fixture (`launch_instance` + `create_volume`)
provisions one instance with a single attached, formatted, mounted, and seeded block
volume. The three test-phase steps all reuse that fixture.

| Step | Phase | Script | Key JSON Fields |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `launch_instance` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/vm/launch_instance.py` | `instance_id`, `state`, `public_ip`, `key_file` (reuses VM script; only under `vm`/`bare_metal`) |
| `create_volume` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/storage/create_volume.py` | `volume_id`, `mount_point`, `sentinel_content`, `operations.{create,attach,format,mount,write_sentinel}` |
| `snapshot_lifecycle` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/storage/snapshot_lifecycle.py` | `volume_id`, `snapshot_id`, `operations.{create_snapshot,restore_volume,verify_data}` (verify_data includes `content_matches`) |
| `volume_resize` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/storage/volume_resize.py` | `volume_id`, `operations.{modify_volume,grow_partition,resize_filesystem,verify_size}` |
| `volume_persistence` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/storage/volume_persistence.py` | `volume_id`, `operations.{stop,start,verify_attached,verify_data}` (verify_data includes `content_matches`) |
| `teardown_volume` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/storage/teardown_volume.py` | `resources_deleted`, `message` |
| `teardown` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/vm/teardown.py` | `resources_deleted`, `message` (reuses VM script) |

### Kubernetes (`k8s.yaml`)

| Step | Phase | Script |
|------|-------|--------|
| `setup` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/k8s/setup.sh` |
| `teardown` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/k8s/teardown.sh` |
| `reset_gpus` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/breakfix/reset_gpus.py` -- `operation.{accepted,node_id,gpu_ids,request_id}`; the reset is asynchronous, so the step reports acceptance plus a handle to poll (BFX01-01) |
| `cordon_node` | test | `providers/shared/breakfix/cordon_node.py` (BFX01-04) |

Validations use `kubectl` directly (or a custom CLI via the `KUBECTL` env var): node counts, GPU operator, pod health, NCCL/NIM workloads. Break-fix cordon and GPU reset are optional provider steps.
The shared cordon reference skips without changing cluster state unless
`tests.settings.breakfix_node` names a dedicated test node.

### Slurm (`slurm.yaml`)

| Step | Phase | Script |
|------|-------|--------|
| `setup` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/slurm/setup.sh` |
| `teardown` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/slurm/teardown.sh` |

Validations use `sinfo`/`srun` directly: partitions, GPU allocation, job scheduling.

### Control Plane (`control-plane.yaml`)

| Step | Phase | Script | Key JSON Fields |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `check_api` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/check_api.py` | `account_id`, `tests` |
| `create_access_key` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/create_access_key.py` | `username`, `access_key_id` |
| `create_tenant` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/create_tenant.py` | `tenant_name`, `tenant_id` |
| `test_access_key` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/test_access_key.py` | `authenticated`, `account_id` |
| `disable_access_key` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/disable_access_key.py` | `status` |
| `verify_key_rejected` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/verify_key_rejected.py` | `rejected`, `error_code` |
| `list_tenants` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/list_tenants.py` | `found_target`, `target_tenant`, `count` |
| `get_tenant` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/get_tenant.py` | `tenant_name`, `description` |
| `s3_object_lifecycle` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/s3_object_lifecycle.py` | `bucket_name`, `object_key`, `operations.{put,get,delete}` (get includes `content_matches`) |
| `delete_access_key` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/delete_access_key.py` | `resources_deleted` |
| `delete_tenant` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/control-plane/delete_tenant.py` | `resources_deleted` |

### Image Registry (`image-registry.yaml`)

| Step | Phase | Script | Key JSON Fields |
|------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| `upload_image` | setup | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/upload_image.py` | `image_id`, `storage_bucket`, `disk_ids` |
| `crud_image` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/crud_image.py` | `image_id`, `operations` |
| `launch_instance` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/launch_instance.py` | `instance_id`, `public_ip`, `key_path` |
| `crud_install_config` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/crud_install_config.py` | `config_id`, `config_name`, `operations` |
| `install_image_bm` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/install_image_bm.py` | `instance_id`, `image_id`, `instance_state` |
| `install_config_bm` | test | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/install_config_bm.py` | `instance_id`, `config_id`, `instance_state`, `state` |
| `teardown_instance` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/teardown.py` | `resources_deleted`, `message` (instance, key pair, security group, instance profile — only under `vm`) |
| `teardown_image` | teardown | `providers/my-isv/scripts/image-registry/teardown.py` | `resources_deleted`, `message` (image, disks, bucket — always) |
