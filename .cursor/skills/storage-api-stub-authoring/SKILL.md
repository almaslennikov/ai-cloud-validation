# Storage API Stub Authoring

Interactive workflow for implementing a provider's storage shim. Follow
this skill end-to-end; do not skip intake or sanity gates.

## Scope boundaries (read first)

**Default workspace:** `isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/`

Implement by **filling in the existing stubs** — replace `TODO` blocks in
`scripts/storage/api.py` and update the sibling manifest. **Do not** `cp` or
`cp -r` my-isv to `providers/<customer>/` unless the user explicitly requests
a separate handoff folder.

| In scope (my-isv) | Path |
| ----------------- | ---- |
| Required | `scripts/storage/api.py` — edit `MyStorageApi` TODO blocks in place |
| Required | `config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` |
| Harness (exists) | `config/storage.yaml` — tweak in place if needed for tests |
| Optional | `scripts/storage/README.md` (document env vars when stub is done) |

AWS/VAST/weka paths under `providers/aws/`, `providers/vast/`, etc. are
**read-only references** — study them; do not copy their layout into new dirs.

**Out of scope — do not create, copy, or edit unless the user explicitly asks:**

- New provider directories (`providers/<customer>/`)
- Other `config/*.yaml` or `scripts/**` trees in my-isv (if any exist)
- Full-provider scaffold (`cp -r my-isv …`)

Running `my-isv/config/storage.yaml` with `--capability kubernetes` is optional,
only when the user wants k8s-integrated runs.

## Outcomes

By session end the user should have:

1. `config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` declaring the provider and pointing at the shim
2. `scripts/storage/.../api.py` implementing `StorageApi` + `build_api()`
3. Documented env vars in `scripts/storage/README.md` (when stub is complete)
4. Passing isolated probes (`probe_shim.py`) before any full `isvctl test run`
5. `config/storage.yaml`'s `storage_manifest` step still pointing at the manifest (already declared)

## Reference implementations (read before coding)

| Backend | Shim | Manifest | Config |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| AWS FSx Lustre | `isvctl/configs/providers/aws/scripts/storage/fsx-lustre/api.py` | `aws/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` | `aws/config/storage.yaml` |
| VAST NFS | `isvctl/configs/providers/vast/scripts/storage/vast/api.py` | `vast/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` | `vast/config/storage.yaml` |
| WEKA | `isvctl/configs/providers/weka/scripts/storage/weka/api.py` | `weka/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` | `weka/config/storage.yaml` |
| **Authoring target (edit in place)** | `my-isv/scripts/storage/api.py` | `my-isv/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` | `my-isv/config/storage.yaml` |

Contract: `isvtest/src/isvtest/core/storage_provider/api.py` (per-method
docstrings cover inputs/outputs, error conditions, and capability/qualifier semantics)
Check drivers:
- `isvtest/src/isvtest/validations/storage_provider.py` (`StorageProviderApiCheck`)
- `isvtest/src/isvtest/validations/storage_quota_enforcement.py`
  (`StorageDirectoryQuotaEnforcementCheck` — live CRUD + write enforcement; needs K8s)

Manifest (schema v1alpha2):

- Schema: `isvctl/schemas/storage-provider-manifest.schema.json`
- Fully-populated example: `my-isv/config/storage-provider-manifest.example.yaml`
- Manifest → step adapter: `isvctl/configs/providers/shared/storage_manifest_to_steps.py`
  (resolves the manifest path, loads no shim; the `storage_manifest` step in `storage.yaml`)

## Session workflow

Copy this checklist and update as you go:

```text
Progress:
- [ ] Phase 0: Intake + environment permission (discover what's there)
- [ ] Phase 1: Confirm my-isv files
- [ ] Phase 2: Generate manifest (discover + Q&A) + config wiring
- [ ] Phase 3: Implement StorageApi methods (one at a time)
- [ ] Phase 4: Isolated sanity probes
- [ ] Phase 5: Targeted StorageProviderApiCheck run
- [ ] Phase 6: Full suite guidance (optional)
```

---

## Phase 0: Intake and environment access

**Ask permission before any discovery command.** If granted, run probes
from repo root. If denied, ask the user to paste command output.

Work through [intake-questions.md](references/intake-questions.md) first.
Summarize answers in a short "Implementation profile" before writing code.

### Environment discovery (when permitted)

Discovery is the **first half of manifest generation**: probe the cluster/API to
propose field values, then confirm the rest by Q&A. The full discover-vs-ask
mapping for every manifest field is in
[manifest-generation.md](references/manifest-generation.md).

**Kubernetes** (adjust namespace/context as needed):

```bash
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get storageclass -o wide
kubectl get sc <sc-name> -o yaml    # provisioner, parameters, mountOptions
kubectl get csidriver
kubectl get nodes --show-labels    # -> node_selector for the CSI/filesystem checks
kubectl get pods -A | grep -i csi  # driver health hint + which nodes run node plugin
```

Map findings into the **v1alpha2 manifest** (which drives
`StorageProviderApiCheck` ONLY):

- `providers[].provider.*` / `identity.*` (infer vendor/protocol/type from the
  driver; ask for version)
- `providers[].capabilities.*` (what the shim's `properties()` reports)
- `providers[].shim.*` (module path / configmap / credentials_secret)

The StorageClass names, NFS expectations, and node selectors are NOT in the
manifest: the CSI / filesystem checks (`K8sCsiStorageTypesCheck`,
`K8sCsiDriverHealthCheck`, `K8sFile*`, `K8sNfsMountOptionsCheck`, …) read them
from the suite/provider config or the `K8S_CSI_*` env vars (see
[config-wiring.md](references/config-wiring.md)).

**Network locality:** If the management API is only reachable in-cluster (VAST VMS pattern), note that `isvctl deploy run` may be required instead of laptop-side `isvctl test run`.

---

## Phase 1: Work in my-isv

Open the existing files — they already contain `TODO` markers and `DEMO_MODE`:

```text
isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/
├── config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml   # shim.module → ../scripts/storage/api.py
├── config/storage.yaml                     # storage_manifest step already points at the manifest
└── scripts/storage/api.py                  # MyStorageApi — fill each TODO block
```

**Do not** create `providers/<customer>/` or copy these files elsewhere unless prompted by the user.

Before coding:

1. Read `scripts/storage/api.py` end-to-end — every method has a `TODO` block to replace
2. Read AWS/VAST reference shims for patterns matching intake answers
3. Update `config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` (v1alpha2): `providers[].name`, `identity`/`provider`, `shim`, `capabilities` — see [manifest-generation.md](references/manifest-generation.md)
4. Keep `shim.module: ../scripts/storage/api.py` (flat my-isv layout)
5. Keep `DEMO_MODE` until real backend calls land — enables smoke without credentials

Rename `MyStorageApi` / `properties()` identity fields to match the backend; keep
`build_api()` at module level.

---

## Phase 2: Manifest generation and config wiring

Generate `config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` (schema **v1alpha2**) using the
**discover-then-ask** workflow in
[manifest-generation.md](references/manifest-generation.md): probe the
environment to propose field values, ask the customer for what you can't
observe, and omit (don't guess) anything still unknown so the dependent check
skips cleanly. `config/storage.yaml` already declares the `storage_manifest` step that
feeds it to the checks — see [config-wiring.md](references/config-wiring.md).

Two files ship beside the template — use them as you fill the blank one:

- `config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml` — blank template to edit in place
- `config/storage-provider-manifest.example.yaml` — fully-populated v1alpha2 reference (every field)

**The manifest is a contract, not docs.** For providers with a `shim:` block,
`StorageProviderApiCheck` cross-checks declared `identity`/`capabilities` against
the running shim and **fails on mismatch** (`manifest-consistency[<name>]`). Only
declare what the shim actually reports; omit a field to leave it unchecked.

**Validate the draft without a backend** (parses the manifest, loads no shim):

```bash
STORAGE_PROVIDER_MANIFEST=isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml \
  uv run python isvctl/configs/providers/shared/storage_manifest_to_steps.py | uv run python -m json.tool
```

**Critical couplings:**

| Artifact | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `shim.module` | Relative to manifest parent; must resolve to `api.py` with `build_api()` |
| `storage_manifest` step in provider YAML | `STORAGE_PROVIDER_MANIFEST` resolves to the `manifest_path` passed to `StorageProviderApiCheck` (on-disk now; ConfigMap mount path in prod) |
| Env vars in shim `__init__` | Runtime config — manifest `attributes` are **informational only** |
| `K8S_CSI_*` env vars / config overrides | StorageClass names for the CSI/filesystem checks — set in config/env, NOT the manifest |

**Provider wiring pattern:** the suite's `storage_provider_api` group is bound to
the `storage_manifest` step — see [config-wiring.md](references/config-wiring.md#provider-yaml-patterns).

**ConfigMap handoff** (document for customer, do not implement operator):

- Manifest → ConfigMap `storage-provider-manifest`, key `manifest.yaml`
- Shim `api.py` → per-provider ConfigMap referenced by `shim.configmap`
- Credentials → per-provider Secret; env vars at runtime

---

## Phase 3: Implement methods (one at a time)

Follow [method-walkthrough.md](references/method-walkthrough.md). **Implement and
probe each method before moving on.** Ask the pointed questions listed there.

### Decision tree: volume lifecycle

```text
Does a CSI driver dynamically provision PVCs on this cluster?
├─ YES (managed K8s — AWS FSx, VAST, WEKA pattern)
│    → create_volume / delete_volume raise NotSupportedError
│    → list_volumes MUST return existing CSI-provisioned volumes (count ≥ 1 for N-020 pass)
│    → Populate Volume.csi (driver + volume_handle) when discoverable
└─ NO (bare-metal / API-managed storage)
     → Implement create_volume + delete_volume
     → Tag volumes with isvtest-run-id for orphan sweep
```

### ProviderProperties

Declare capabilities honestly in `storage-provider-manifest.yaml`, and implement
only the corresponding methods in `scripts/storage/api.py`. `new_implementation()`
detects which surfaces are backed and advertises the merged capability set.
Directory-quota shims should also exercise
`StorageDirectoryQuotaEnforcementCheck` under a K8s config (optional
`pvc_name` / `pod_name` reuse for faster iteration — see provider READMEs).

---

## Phase 4: Isolated sanity probes

Run **before** full suite. Order matters.

### 4a. Manifest loads

```bash
uv run python -c "
from isvtest.core.storage import load_provider_registry
ps = load_provider_registry({'manifest_path': 'isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml'})
print([p.name for p in ps if p.has_shim])
"
```

### 4b. Shim probe script

```bash
uv run python .cursor/skills/storage-api-stub-authoring/scripts/probe_shim.py \
  --manifest isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml
```

Expect: `health_check` ok, `get_tenant_quota` with `hard_limit_bytes > 0`, and either
`create_volume` path or `list_volumes` returning ≥1 volume (CSI fallback).

### 4c. Backend-specific CLI probes

Use patterns from the reference READMEs:

- **AWS:** `aws sts get-caller-identity`, `aws fsx describe-file-systems`, `aws service-quotas get-service-quota`
- **VAST:** `curl -H "Authorization: Api-Token $VAST_TOKEN" "https://$VAST_ENDPOINT/api/quotas/"`
- **Generic:** whatever authenticated GET the shim's `health_check` uses

### 4d. Demo mode smoke (no credentials, optional)

Uses the existing `my-isv/config/storage.yaml` harness:

```bash
ISVCTL_DEMO_MODE=1 \
  uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/config/storage.yaml
```

### 4e. Contract / validation unit tests

```bash
# Shim contract package (ABC, loader, mock)
uv run pytest isvtest/src/isvtest/core/storage_provider/tests/

# StorageProviderApiCheck behavior (framework tests)
uv run pytest isvtest/tests/test_storage_provider.py

# Provider-specific hermetic shim tests, when added:
uv run pytest isvtest/tests/test_aws_fsx_lustre_shim.py
uv run pytest isvtest/tests/test_weka_shim.py
uv run pytest isvtest/tests/test_storage_quota_enforcement.py
```

**Gate:** Do not proceed to Phase 5 until 4a–4c pass (4d acceptable during scaffolding).

---

## Phase 5: Targeted acceptance check (optional)

Run only when the user wants end-to-end `StorageProviderApiCheck` validation.
Requires a `storage.yaml` with a `storage_manifest` step.

```bash
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/config/storage.yaml
```

For K8s-integrated runs, run the same `storage.yaml` with `--capability kubernetes`
— do not create a new config or a full provider tree.

**Expected CSI fallback (not a failure):**

```text
volume-provisioning[<name>] SKIPPED: create_volume not implemented; observed N CSI-provisioned volume(s)
```

**Common failures → fixes:**

| Symptom | Fix |
| ------- | --- |
| `AuthenticationError` on health_check | Fix creds / network / IAM |
| `hard_limit_bytes=0` | Wrong quota source or empty tenant |
| `observed 0 ... via list_volumes` | Create a PVC against the StorageClass first |
| Manifest not found | Run from repo root; fix `manifest_path` |

---

## Phase 6: Full suite (optional)

Only after Phase 5 passes. Run `storage.yaml` (which imports only
`isvctl/configs/suites/storage.yaml`, never alongside `suites/k8s.yaml`) with
`--capability kubernetes`, and align:

- StorageClass names via the `K8S_CSI_*` env vars (`K8S_CSI_BLOCK_SC`,
  `K8S_CSI_SHARED_FS_SC`, `K8S_CSI_NFS_SC`) or literal
  overrides in your config — these are NOT in the manifest
- `k8s_storage` CSI checks beyond the shim: `K8sCsiStorageTypesCheck`, `K8sCsiStorageQuotaApiCheck`, `K8sCsiProvisioningModesCheck`, `K8sCsiConcurrentPvcCheck`, `K8sCsiPvcExpandCheck`, `K8sCsiDriverHealthCheck`
- `k8s_filesystem` checks (`K8sFileLockingCheck`, `K8sCrossNodeWriteVisibilityCheck`, …) and `node_selector` (literal dict) when CSI requires labeled nodes

```bash
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/my-isv/config/<k8s-or-storage-config>.yaml
```

---

## Agent behavior rules

1. **Edit my-isv in place** — fill `scripts/storage/api.py` TODO blocks; never `cp -r my-isv` to a new provider dir unless the user explicitly asks for handoff.
2. **One method at a time** — implement `properties` + `__init__`, then `health_check`, then `get_tenant_quota`, then volume methods.
3. **Ask before assuming** — especially CSI vs API provisioning, tenant model, quota semantics.
4. **Match reference style** — env-driven config, tight IAM/API surface, `NotSupportedError` for CSI-owned lifecycle.
5. **Do not add setup scripts** — this skill does not author provider orchestration steps.
6. **Document env vars** in `scripts/storage/README.md` when the stub is done (in-scope).
7. **Test harness on request** — run `storage.yaml` only when the user wants to run checks; its `storage_manifest` step is already wired.
