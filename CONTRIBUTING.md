# Contributing to AI Cloud Validation Suite

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is a **Python monorepo** with three interdependent packages (`isvctl`, `isvtest`, `isvreporter`) managed as a [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) workspace. It orchestrates GPU cluster validation across Kubernetes, Slurm, and bare-metal environments, so even small changes can have cross-package effects. Please read through this guide before opening a pull request.

## About This Codebase

AI Cloud Validation suite is a monorepo with three packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **isvctl** | CLI controller - orchestrates setup, test, and teardown phases via step-based configs |
| **isvtest** | Validation engine - pytest-based framework with dynamic test discovery |
| **isvreporter** | Results reporter - uploads test results to the ISV Lab Service API |

Changes often span packages. For example, adding a new validation involves `isvtest` (test class), `isvctl` (config schema / stubs), and possibly `isvreporter` (result format). Please consider cross-package impact when contributing.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Be respectful and inclusive in all interactions, help maintain a welcoming environment, and focus on constructive feedback in reviews. Please report unacceptable behavior to GitHub_Conduct@nvidia.com.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu) or WSL2
- Git
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (Python package manager)

### Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation.git
cd ai-cloud-validation
uv sync
uvx pre-commit install
```

## Development

### Common Tasks

```bash
make help          # Show all available targets
make test          # Run tests for all packages
make lint          # Run linting on all packages
make format        # Format code on all packages
make pre-commit    # Run pre-commit on all packages
make build         # Build all packages
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
make plan          # Render docs/test-plan.yaml to AsciiDoc and interactive HTML
```

### Per-Package Development

```bash
cd isvtest  # or isvctl, isvreporter
uv sync
uvx pre-commit run -a
uv run pytest -m unit
uv build
```

### Running Tools

```bash
uv run isvctl --help
uv run isvtest --help
uv run isvreporter --help
```

### Code Quality

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting, and `pyright` for type checking. All code must include type annotations and docstrings (PEP 257).

```bash
uvx ruff check --fix    # Lint
uvx ruff format          # Format
uvx pyright              # Type check
```

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on commit. To run manually:

```bash
uvx pre-commit run -a
```

## Testing

All CI checks must pass before a PR can be merged.

### Unit Tests

```bash
# All packages
make test

# Specific package
uv --directory=isvtest run pytest tests/ -v
uv --directory=isvctl run pytest -v
uv --directory=isvreporter run pytest -v
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require access to a real cluster:

```bash
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/suites/k8s.yaml
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/microk8s.yaml
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/minikube.yaml
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/k3s.yaml
```

See the [Local Development Guide](docs/guides/local-development.md) for MicroK8s, Minikube, and k3s setup.

### Validating an Unreleased Test Locally

New validations are gated by `released_tests.json` until the next release
bump. To exercise a new check end-to-end before that, set
`ISVTEST_INCLUDE_UNRELEASED=1` (see [Releasing](#releasing) for the full
workflow). Without it the orchestrator logs `Skipping unreleased validation
'<Name>'` and the check is a no-op.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the [upstream repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation) and create a branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** following the coding guidelines above.
3. **Run the full check suite** before opening the PR:

   ```bash
   make test && make lint
   ```

4. **Sign off all commits** (see [DCO](#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco) below).
5. **Open a pull request** with a clear description of what changed and why.

### PR Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the problem and solution.
- Reference any related issues.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change.
- Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review.
- Be responsive to feedback and code review comments.
- Assign reviewer as `NCP ISV Lab Maintainer` - at least one engineer will review the PR.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project requires the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) process for all contributions. The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing.

### Signing Your Commits

Add a `Signed-off-by` line to every commit using the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This appends a line like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

**Tip:** Create a Git alias to always sign off:

```bash
git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'
# Now use: git ci -m "Your commit message"
```

### Signing Off Multiple Commits

```bash
git rebase --signoff origin/main
```

### DCO Enforcement

All pull requests are automatically checked for DCO compliance via the DCO bot. Pull requests with unsigned commits cannot be merged until all commits are properly signed off.

## Releasing

### Versioning Policy

The project follows [semver](https://semver.org/) but is still pre-1.0
(experimental), and that frames how we bump:

- **Major** (`X.Y.Z` -> `(X+1).0.0`) - reserved for graduation out of the
  experimental `0.x` line. Do not bump until the project is no longer
  declared experimental.
- **Minor** (`X.Y.Z` -> `X.(Y+1).0`) - milestone releases: a coherent set of
  new features, a new domain coming online, or a behavior change worth
  flagging to downstream consumers.
- **Patch** (`X.Y.Z` -> `X.Y.(Z+1)`) - a decent batch of fixes/features/chores
  that has accumulated on `main` and is worth cutting, or an urgent fix that
  needs to ship on its own. An urgent fix for an older minor is cut from a
  maintenance branch instead of `main` (see [Out-of-Band
  Releases](#out-of-band-releases)).

External operators only run the **released** tests - the set pinned by
`isvtest/src/isvtest/released_tests.json` at each tag - so every tag has a
fixed, reproducible test set. `make bump-*` regenerates that manifest from
the current validation catalog as part of the bump (see the next section),
which is how unreleased validations on `main` become released at a tag.

### Version Bumping

All packages share a single version. To bump:

```bash
make bump-patch             # 0.4.2 -> 0.4.3
make bump-minor             # 0.4.2 -> 0.5.0
make bump-major             # 0.4.2 -> 1.0.0
make bump VERSION=1.2.3     # Explicit version
```

The script updates all `pyproject.toml` files, refreshes
`isvtest/src/isvtest/released_tests.json` from the current validation
catalog, and runs `uv lock`. [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) is populated
separately by `make changelog-fill` after the release tag exists (see the
next section). Newly added validations are not run by client configs
until they appear in that `released_tests.json` manifest, so adding tests
to `main` and releasing them are separate steps.

### Changelog

[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) is the canonical, per-tag changelog (Keep a
Changelog format), populated by `make changelog-fill` rather than by PR
authors. After cutting a release tag (typically via `make bump-*`), run:

```bash
make changelog-fill                # auto-detect (codex -> claude -> cursor-agent)
make changelog-fill CLI=codex      # explicit codex
make changelog-fill CLI=claude     # explicit claude
make changelog-fill CLI=cursor     # explicit cursor-agent
```

The chosen LLM CLI inspects `git log` and fetches PR details to generate
the new section, then edits `CHANGELOG.md` in place. Review the diff and
tidy any awkward wording before committing. The prompt lives in
[`scripts/changelog-prompt.md`](scripts/changelog-prompt.md) and the
dispatch logic in [`scripts/changelog-fill.sh`](scripts/changelog-fill.sh);
either can be tweaked without changing the Makefile.

For per-milestone stakeholder overviews (e.g. quarterly summaries),
`scripts/generate_release_notes.py` fetches issues and PRs attached to a
GitHub milestone — that is a separate tool with a different purpose.

When validating unreleased tests locally from `main`, disable that release
filter explicitly:

```bash
ISVTEST_INCLUDE_UNRELEASED=1 uv run isvctl test run -f config.yaml
ISVTEST_INCLUDE_UNRELEASED=1 uv run isvtest test --config config.yaml
```

### Creating a Release Tag

After bumping, open a PR, review, and merge. Then the repo maintainers will create a tag:

1. Go to **Actions** > **Create version tag** in GitHub
2. Enter the version (e.g. `1.0.0`, without leading `v`)
3. The workflow verifies all `pyproject.toml` files match, then creates and pushes `v1.0.0`

The workflow tags whichever branch it is dispatched from, and only `main` or a
`releases/**` branch is accepted. It will not re-cut an existing tag - tags are
never deleted, so a mistake means burning that version - and it refuses to tag a
commit that CI has not passed on. Since merges are squashed, that commit is a new
one no pull request tested, so wait for its CI to finish before dispatching.

### Out-of-Band Releases

To patch an older minor without shipping everything that has landed on `main`
since, cut a maintenance branch named `releases/<minor>.x` from the tag being
patched, and tag from there.

```bash
git switch -c releases/<minor>.x v<tag>     # once per minor, from the tag
git switch -c <topic> releases/<minor>.x    # then cherry-pick and bump
git cherry-pick -x <sha>
make bump-patch
```

Open the PR against the release branch, then dispatch **Create version tag**
with that branch selected.

Conventions:

- Fixes land on `main` first and are cherry-picked onto the release branch,
  never the reverse.
- The release branch is not merged back. Forward-port only the CHANGELOG
  section, not the version bump.
- `make bump-patch` derives the version from the nearest ancestor tag, so it
  increments the release branch's own line.
- Workflows run from the branch they are on, so a branch cut from an older tag
  carries that tag's CI config. Add `releases/**` to the `push` triggers in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` on the branch, or its tip is never tested.
- `released_tests.json` is regenerated from the release branch's catalog, so a
  cherry-picked validation ships there while staying unreleased on `main` until
  the next `main` bump. Run the bump on the branch; never cherry-pick it.
- Confirm the version is free first - a bump can reach `main` without a tag
  ever being cut, which burns the number.
