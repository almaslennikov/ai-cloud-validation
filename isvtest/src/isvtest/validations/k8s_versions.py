"""Kubernetes version support and control-plane patching checks (K8S02).

K8S02 asks three things of a managed Kubernetes offering: that it support the
three most recent upstream minors, that a new minor appear within 4-6 weeks of
its upstream release, and that control-plane security patching be automated.
None of that is visible from inside a cluster, so both checks read a provider
step for the claim and compare it against two things the provider does not
control - the upstream release index, fetched by its own step, and the version
the API server itself reports.

    The catalogue of versions a tenant can create or upgrade to is a property of
    the provider's control plane API, not of any one cluster, so the bound step
    reports it and this check compares it against the upstream release index.

    A minor released within ``availability_grace_days`` is not required yet -
    that is the 4-6 week window K8S02 allows for a new release to land - so a
    provider is only faulted for minors it has had time to pick up.

    The window is ``supported_minor_count`` minors wide - three by K8S02's
    wording, so a cluster may sit at N-2.

    The cluster under test is held to the same window. A catalogue listing a
    minor is not the same as running one, and a cloud certified on a minor
    upstream has already moved past does not evidence the support requirement -
    so a cluster outside the window fails even when the provider's catalogue is
    complete.

    Taking the catalogue at face value would also let a provider report an
    offering other than the one it runs, so it is corroborated against that
    same cluster: a catalogue that omits the in-window minor the tenant is
    demonstrably running is describing something else. That is what stops a
    provider from taking the grace window for a minor it is already serving.

        when nothing is wrong leaves a reader unable to tell whether the
        cluster was inspected at all, or which cluster answered.

        How far behind the cluster is comes from its position in the upstream
        list: index 0 is the newest minor, so anything at or past
        ``minor_count`` is outside the window. A cloud is certified on the
        version it is certified on, and a cluster upstream has moved past does
        not evidence support for the window even when the provider's catalogue
        lists it.

        Falling out of the window is not instantaneous fault, though. A cluster
        sitting at the window's floor is pushed out the moment a new minor
        ships, through no act of its own, so it gets the same number of days to
        move as the provider gets to publish a new minor. The clock runs from
        the release of the minor whose arrival displaced it - at index 3 that
        is the newest minor, at index 4 the one before it - so the runway is
        granted once, not renewed by every subsequent release.

        An in-window cluster is also checked against the catalogue, which is
        what stops a provider from taking the availability grace for a minor it
        is demonstrably already serving.

        Marks the check failed and returns ``None`` when the cluster does not

    shows the automation has acted: the API server's own version has to be at
    the newest patch upstream publishes for its minor, or no further behind it

    The version the API server reports is the ground truth throughout; the

    report the patch it ships for the minor rather than a per-cluster reading,
