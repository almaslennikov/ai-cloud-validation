"""Break-fix / break-fix validations (BFX01-BFX06).

Provider-agnostic checks over step JSON output. Lifecycle steps may emit
``skipped`` when a platform lacks the mutating break-fix API (for example
Maestro/GPUd integrations not yet wired). Query steps assert observability
of maintenance, repair, and diagnostic signals where the provider exposes them.

Every "is this signal observable" requirement (BFX02, BFX05, BFX06) is held to
the same evidence bar by ``_QueryableRecordsCheck``: the provider must report
the signal as observable *and* return at least one record demonstrating it. A
self-declared boolean is not evidence -- a provider could emit it for an API it
never called -- so a capability claimed with no records skips rather than
passes, and the requirement stays visibly unproven.

Several checks here are *empty shells*: the class and its JSON contract exist,
but no provider implements the capability yet, so the contract is the whole
deliverable -- it is what an ISV would implement against.

    """Validate a GPU health monitoring process is running on every node (BFX04-01).

    Deliberately agent-neutral. The requirement originally named GPUd and NV
    Sentinel, but a test written against a named product outlives the product,
    and either could be cancelled; what a tenant is owed is that *something* is
    watching GPU health. So this check never matches on a name -- the provider's
    step decides which processes count on its platform and reports the one it
    found there.

    Which is why ``agent_name`` is required rather than merely documented. Once
    the name is not matched, it is the only thing separating a real probe from a
    hardcoded ``true``: a record of ``{"running": true}`` is the provider
    asserting its own capability, the same say-so the BFX02/BFX05/BFX06 checks
    refuse. It is also what makes the result actionable, since an operator
    reading "a process is running" cannot tell whether it is the right one.

    ``agents`` must cover every GPU node the platform has, not just the ones the
    step was configured with or could reach. A step that reports a single healthy
    node and silently omits the rest passes while proving nothing about the
    fleet, so a node with nothing running belongs in the list as
    ``running: false`` -- and may omit ``agent_name``, having none to report --
    rather than being dropped. A site with no GPU nodes at all is the one case
    with nothing to assert, and is a structured skip rather than an empty list.

    ``nodes_expected`` is what makes that coverage an assertion instead of a
    request. Without it the check can only judge the list it is handed and has no
    way to know the list is whole, so a step configured with three of a site's
    sixty-four GPU nodes passes BFX04-01 for the whole site. Naming the fleet
    size separately forces the provider to say what it was covering, and to say
    it somewhere other than the list it is being graded on -- the same reason
    ``agent_name`` is required above. A provider that will not report its GPU
    node count has not answered the requirement, so its absence fails rather
    than relaxing into "however many turned up".
