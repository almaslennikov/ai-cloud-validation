| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description | Test details | Status |
| :----- | :--------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----- |
| NET05 | Connection to DGXC Storage | Transport: Private Cloud interconnect + VIF + BGP (preferred for better performance/security). DGXC will establish connectivity to NCP through a mutually agreed Point of Presence (POP) using Private Cloud Interconnect, functionally equivalent to AWS Direct Connect, GCP Dedicated Interconnect, Azure ExpressRoute, and OCI FastConnect. Connectivity will be provisioned with a Virtual Interface (VIF) and routing established via BGP. The interconnect will be used to exchange private IP space (RFC1918, as well as 7.0.0.0/8) between DGXC and NCP. | INFO | active |
| NET06 | Cluster Local Internet Access | Cluster Internet access: Egress NAT IPs should be a static pool dedicated to only Nvidia Cluster/Tenancy/VPC. These persistent IP addresses must be used exclusively for DGXC traffic and shall not be shared with or carry traffic from other NCP tenants. Availability: Must support redundant upstream paths to ensure connectivity under failure. | INFO | active |

## Capacity & Fleet Management

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description | Test details | Status |
| :----- | :--------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----- |
| CAP01 | Governance metrics | Required Governance Metrics The core metrics needed to track fleet health are: Delivered: Nodes/GPUs provisioned and available to NVIDIA, allocated to a specific account/project/tenant. Healthy: Nodes/GPUs functioning and meeting SLA requirements, allocated to a specific account/project/tenant. Reserved: Resources allocated to a specific account/project/tenant. Total Active/In-Use: Nodes/GPUs currently in use within a specific account/project/tenant. | INFO | active |
| CAP02 | Resource Governance API Metrics | The Resource Governance API must return the following information for each node: Node ID (Unique identifier for a GPU node) Health State (Healthy/Unhealthy classification) Instance ID (Identifier for virtual workload) Creation Timestamp (Time workload/node was created) Hardware Type (Descriptor for the hardware model) GPU Count (Number of GPUs per node) Top-levelAccount/ID (Identifier for the top-level organization/account) Sub-LevelProject/ID (Identifier for the nested project/sub-account) In Use (True/False status indicating if the GPU Node is turned on and in use) Region (Region of the data center where nodes are deployed) | add | active |
| CAP03 | Resource Discovery APIs | It is not acceptable to have capacity be “handed” to DGXC through a phone, slack or email message. For example, when cluster first comes online, nodes/racks are likely being handed off weekly (or more frequently). Instead, please provide the following mechanism (and we can poll): Programmatic Capacity Discovery: All newly delivered capacity must be discoverable via a centralized API. This "Resource Index" must provide a stable resource identifier and some information on why it’s being provided (e.g. capacity fulfillment on gb300 project, break-fix / RMA return to cluster, etc) | add | active |
| CAP04 | Logical Compartmentalization & Resource Isolation | To ensure performance consistency and security, the NCP must support strict logical and physical isolation of NVIDIA’s reserved capacity. Capacity Reservations: A mechanism to logically group and "pin" a set of resources (compute, network, storage) to accounts (or equivalent constructs) in an NVIDIA tenancy Atomic Allocation: Support for reserving a "topology block" as a single unit, ensuring all resources in that block share identical performance characteristics and security boundaries. | INFO | active |
| CAP05 | Unified Health & Lifecycle APIs | NVIDIA requires a "single source of truth" for the health of both physical hosts and logical compute primitives. Per-Host Health: Real-time API access to the health bits of physical hardware (GPU state, thermal status, memory health). Primitive-Level Status: Health aggregation at the cluster, nodegroup, or reservation level to identify broad infrastructure failures (e.g., a spine switch failure affecting a whole block). | INFO | active |
