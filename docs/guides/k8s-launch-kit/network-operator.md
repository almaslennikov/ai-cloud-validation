# Network Operator connectivity validation through Kubernetes Launch Kit

## Scope

The Network Operator suite performs one validation operation:

```text
l8k validate --user-config <complete-config> --deployment-files <rendered-directory>
```

It reports the connectivity matrix produced by Launch Kit. After that command
is attempted, an always-run linked finalizer invokes:

```text
l8k sosreport --output-dir <artifact-directory>/sosreport
```

The diagnostic command runs whether validation passes, returns an error, or
produces a failing connectivity matrix. It is evidence collection, not a
second catalog test. The suite does not install
or verify the `l8k` binary, discover topology, generate manifests, deploy
Network Operator, run a separate Kubernetes preflight, or clean cluster state.

Those activities are prerequisites. Before starting the suite, the ISV must
provide a reachable Kubernetes cluster, bring Network Operator and the desired
networking profile into the expected state, create a complete Launch Kit
configuration, and retain the corresponding rendered deployment files.

There are no separate AI Cloud Validation tests for RoCE, InfiniBand, SR-IOV,
RDMA Shared, host-device, ICMP, rping, bandwidth, or GPUDirect. The supplied
Launch Kit configuration determines the topology and enabled validation
families. This avoids duplicating Launch Kit's configuration and applicability
model in AI Cloud Validation.

## Architecture

```text
Network Operator provider YAML
  -> validation step
     -> adapter.py
        -> l8k validate --user-config ... --deployment-files ... --output json
        -> retained argv, stdout, stderr, exit code, duration, and HTML report
  -> Network Operator suite YAML
     -> LaunchKitConnectivityCheck
        -> one subtest for every Launch Kit connectivity row
  -> linked finalizer, after the connectivity assertion
     -> adapter.py
        -> l8k sosreport --output-dir .../evidence/sosreport
        -> retained diagnostic directory, stdout, stderr, exit code, and duration
  -> console and JUnit results
```

The relevant files are:

| Layer | File |
|---|---|
| Production entrypoint | `isvctl/configs/providers/k8s-launch-kit/config/network-operator.yaml` |
| CLI transport | `isvctl/configs/providers/k8s-launch-kit/scripts/adapter.py` |
| Catalog wiring | `isvctl/configs/suites/k8s-launch-kit/network-operator.yaml` |
| Result interpretation | `isvtest/src/isvtest/validations/k8s_launch_kit/checks.py` |
| Mock-backed provider tests | `isvctl/tests/providers/k8s_launch_kit/` |
| Result-check unit tests | `isvtest/tests/k8s_launch_kit/` |

The generic provider in
`isvctl/configs/providers/k8s-launch-kit/config/provider.yaml` still mirrors the
complete Launch Kit lifecycle for other consumers. The Network Operator
entrypoint does not import it, so none of those lifecycle steps are inherited.

The `l8k` installation must also make the upstream
`kubectl-netop_sosreport` helper available to `l8k sosreport`. Validate this
once with a direct `l8k sosreport --output-dir <temporary-directory>` call. If
Launch Kit reports that the script is missing, install the helper below the
same installation prefix at `share/l8k/scripts/kubectl-netop_sosreport` before
running the suite.

## Inputs

The Network Operator provider exposes only these settings:

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `executable` | no | `l8k` command or absolute executable path; default is `l8k` |
| `user_config` | yes | Complete Launch Kit cluster configuration |
| `deployment_files` | yes | Existing rendered deployment directory validated by Launch Kit |
| `working_dir` | no | Provider process working directory |
| `artifact_dir` | no | Directory for command evidence |
| `environment` | no | String environment entries forwarded to Launch Kit, such as `KUBECONFIG` |

Paths accept `~`, but absolute paths are preferable in automation. The adapter
resolves both paths, verifies that `user_config` is a file and
`deployment_files` is a directory, and passes the resolved paths to Launch Kit.
It does not copy, merge, parse, or modify either input.

Launch Kit owns every setting inside the complete config, including the
selected profile, validation mode, enabled checks, GPUDirect behavior,
bandwidth thresholds, per-operation timeouts, routing, IP pools, and resource
names. AI Cloud Validation stores no copies of those defaults.

Do not also put `--user-config` or `--deployment-files` in a raw Launch Kit
argument list. The adapter rejects duplicate path sources rather than allowing
ambiguous last-value behavior.

## Running the suite

From the repository root:

```bash
uv run isvctl test run \
  -f isvctl/configs/providers/k8s-launch-kit/config/network-operator.yaml \
  --capability kubernetes \
  --set 'context.k8s_launch_kit.user_config=/absolute/path/cluster-config.yaml' \
  --set 'context.k8s_launch_kit.deployment_files=/absolute/path/deployment' \
  --no-upload -- -v
```

To use a kubeconfig that is not selected by the normal client environment, add:

```text
--set 'context.k8s_launch_kit.environment={"KUBECONFIG":"/absolute/path/kubeconfig.yaml"}'
```

Omit `--no-upload` when the run should use the configured AI Cloud Labs upload
path.

## Selecting connectivity checks

Selection happens in the Launch Kit config, not with AI Cloud Validation
labels. For example, disabling Launch Kit GPUDirect validation means no
`gpudirect_dmabuf` rows are emitted. The wrapper then reports the remaining
rows only; it does not create a skipped or failed GPUDirect placeholder.

Likewise, the suite does not infer a fabric or deployment mode from labels.
Run it once for the exact cluster state described by the supplied files. To
validate another topology, provision that topology and invoke the same suite
with its config and deployment directory.

## Timeouts

The `launch_kit_validate` step has `timeout: null`. Launch Kit calculates and
logs its connectivity-matrix budget by default, or honors the timeout configured
by the user. This prevents an independent isvctl watchdog from terminating a
valid large matrix before Launch Kit's bounded checks finish. An enclosing CI
job may still impose an overall job timeout.

The `launch_kit_sosreport` finalizer has a 30-minute orchestration watchdog.
Unlike connectivity validation, the current Launch Kit sosreport command does
not calculate its own total deadline. A timeout or sosreport command error is
reported as a separate `test-teardown` orchestration failure; it does not
replace the connectivity test result.

## Results and errors

`LaunchKitConnectivityCheck` imports Launch Kit's native JUnit cases using the
same `report_subtest` mechanism as Kubernetes conformance tests. Use a Launch
Kit binary supporting `validate --junit-path` (NVIDIA/k8s-launch-kit#288).
Names, durations, failures, native disabled-check skips, and diagnostic evidence
are preserved. A failed command or a report with no executed connectivity cases
fails the owning validation.

The adapter keeps the raw report and creates a second report with four skipped
suites for the opposing fabric. For an Ethernet cluster, an example suite is:

```xml
<testsuite name="K8sEastWestNetworkRDMAPing-infiniband"
           tests="1" failures="0" errors="0" skipped="1" time="0.000">
  <testcase name="K8sEastWestNetworkRDMAPing-infiniband"
            classname="network.connectivity" time="0.000">
    <skipped type="fabric_not_configured"
             message="Cluster fabric is not configured for this fabric type: infiniband" />
  </testcase>
</testsuite>
```

The other three families receive equivalent entries. InfiniBand clusters get
Ethernet skips. Fabric comes from the native suite names; user configuration
is not parsed by the adapter. Reports with no fabric suites (for example, an
early setup failure) retain their native errors without guessing a fabric.

The standard `isvctl --junitxml` output (default `_output/junit-validation.xml`)
contains these cases as `LaunchKitConnectivityCheck::<native-case-name>` under
the phase suite, like other composite validations. Existing phase merging,
remote report download, and `isvreporter` upload therefore include the skips.
The native report retains its family suites and aggregate metadata separately.

The sosreport finalizer runs after this assertion. If sosreport itself fails,
the connectivity result remains intact and the overall orchestration reports
the diagnostic-collection failure separately.

## Evidence

The adapter writes:

```text
_output/k8s-launch-kit/network-operator/
  work/
  evidence/
    k8s-launch-kit-validation-report.html
    launch-kit-junit.raw.xml
    launch-kit-junit.xml
    commands/validate/
      command.json
      stdout.txt
      stderr.log
    commands/sosreport/
      command.json
      stdout.txt
      stderr.log
    sosreport/
      ... files produced by the Network Operator sosreport helper ...
```

`command.json` records the resolved argv, exit code, and duration. `stdout.txt`
contains Launch Kit's complete JSON stream, including static validation,
connectivity, and report-path documents; `stderr.log` retains CLI progress and
diagnostics. The adapter uses the emitted `reportPath` as the authoritative
source, copies the HTML file to
`evidence/k8s-launch-kit-validation-report.html`, and registers the copied path
as the `validation_report` artifact. The original report remains at the path
written by Launch Kit, normally below the supplied deployment directory. A
report emitted for a failed connectivity matrix is copied in the same way. If
Launch Kit advertises a report that cannot be read, the provider returns an
evidence-retention error instead of silently reusing an older report.

The raw and completed JUnit paths are registered as `validation_junit_raw` and
`validation_junit` artifacts. Stale files are removed before each validation;
a missing or malformed report is an evidence error even when the process exits
successfully. Reports emitted by failing runs are retained and imported too.
The main merged JUnit file is uploaded through the existing reporting service;
the separate native XML and HTML files remain local evidence artifacts.

The sosreport command currently streams human-readable output even when the
global `--output` flag is available. The adapter therefore preserves that
stream in `commands/sosreport/stdout.txt` and emits its own normal structured
step envelope; it does not attempt to reinterpret the diagnostic contents.

## PRD boundary

This integration covers reportable Launch Kit connectivity validation. It
deliberately treats topology discovery, manifest generation, installation,
deployment health preparation, profile selection, and restoration as external
prerequisites. Tests that intentionally mutate Network Operator state require a
separate transaction and restoration design before they can be added.
