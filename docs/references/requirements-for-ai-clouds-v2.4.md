## Introduction

### Purpose and Intent

This document serves three main purposes:

1. **Setting requirements for NVIDIA Cloud Partners (NCP) delivering GPU capacity to NVIDIA.**
   This is the primary requirements document from NVIDIA to any NCP providing NVIDIA GPU and AI compute and software services.
   These requirements cover the full stack of AI cloud infrastructure services and operations needed to run NVIDIA DGX Cloud, expanding on the NVIDIA hardware reference design.
2. **Providing a reference set of requirements for the industry.**
   NVIDIA is publishing this document openly so that NCPs, GPU data center operators, and AI practitioners can use it as a reference for the capabilities a large GPU consumer requires.
3. **Defining the NVIDIA service delivery expectations.**
   NVIDIA expects services to be delivered as Generally Available (GA) to all customers, not as bespoke implementations built for NVIDIA alone.
   NVIDIA expects operational excellence, transparent communication, and proactive engagement from all partners.

NVIDIA will consider additional services that an NCP offers or plans to offer beyond what is described here.

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the [Definitions](#definitions) section for defined terms used throughout this guide.

### Interpretation and Definitions

#### Interpretation

The interpretations and defined terms in this section apply throughout this guide.
A more specific definition or measurement rule stated for a particular requirement or service applies within that narrower scope.

Provider-specific product names and resource constructs may differ from the terminology used here.
Compliance is determined by whether the provider’s implementation satisfies the meaning and required outcome stated in this guide.

##### Normative Language

This guide uses the following normative terms to indicate requirement levels.

* Shall and must indicate a mandatory requirement.
* Should indicates a recommended but non-mandatory capability or practice.
  If a capability is intended to be required for compliance, the requirement must use shall or must.
* May indicates a permitted option.
* Preferred and nice-to-have indicate non-mandatory evaluation preferences and do not establish minimum compliance requirements.

##### Relationship to Deployment-Specific Requirements

An Ancillary Services Document or other deployment-specific agreement may establish site-specific quantities, topology, performance targets, schedules, and additional requirements.
It does not waive or weaken a baseline requirement in this guide unless it expressly identifies the affected requirement and the approved exception.

#### Definitions

The following table defines the terms used throughout this guide.

| Term | Definition |

### Testing Compliance

NVIDIA aims to test conformance to all of the requirements described in this document.
Not all requirements are easily testable.
For example, many operational requirements and SLAs require measurement over long periods of time or during failure scenarios.
For requirements without a clear test mechanism, compliance is checked through a self-grading process and review.

#### AI Cloud Ready

Where possible, NVIDIA provides testing capabilities.
NVIDIA has created the [AI Cloud Ready test suite](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ISV-NCP-Validation-Suite).
This suite is continually evolving, but one of its main goals is to test as many of the requirements found in this document as possible.
Refer to the AI Cloud Ready documentation for details on how to run the tests.
Tests are added regularly, so review the [Requirements Test Matrix](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-cloud-validation/blob/main/docs/requirements/test-requirements-matrix.adoc) to find which tests validate which requirements.

#### Exemplar Performance

While some performance testing happens in AI Cloud Ready, the primary mechanism to validate real-world cluster performance is the NVIDIA Exemplar program.
This program seeks to improve performance per total cost of ownership (TCO) with hardware and software recipes, references, tools, and capabilities.
Run the latest publicly available benchmark test suite from the [NVIDIA Exemplar Performance repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/exemplar-performance) and always pick the latest release version from that repository.
The release must be completed on one uniform hardware cluster type.
Run all the workloads for a given release and share the results in the following template.

| Req ID | Feature | Min Size | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **BM01** | Benchmarking for Exemplar Performance | Run per Scalable Unit, for example, a 512 GPU cluster | Achieve performance within 5% of an NVIDIA-provided target. This target should be met on every Scalable Unit (SU) handed off. |

## Service Levels

NCPs should be able to demonstrate the ability to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs) to be considered for NVIDIA consumption, which is sometimes called NVIDIA offtake or offtake.

Unless otherwise stated, published availability, response, performance, metering, and telemetry targets in this guide are minimum service levels to be incorporated into the applicable SLA.
Mandatory capabilities that are not measured service levels are stated as requirements.

### Support and Incident Response

The NCP may use its own published incident and ticket severity scale, and the NVIDIA expectation is at least three levels.
For NVIDIA services, SLA targets are measured against the following NVIDIA severity model: Sev-1 (critical or outage), Sev-2 (major or degraded), Sev-3 (minor), and Sev-4 (request or informational).

The NCP shall maintain a documented mapping from its severity scale to the NVIDIA model.
Where the NCP severity scale has fewer than four levels, or an NCP severity level spans more than one NVIDIA severity level, the more severe NVIDIA level and its associated targets shall apply.

The following response targets apply to the NVIDIA severity model.

- **Sev-1 (critical or outage) initial response**: 15 minutes.
  The NCP shall work continuously, 24x7, until service is restored or a workaround is available.
- **Sev-2 through Sev-4**: Response and resolution targets shall be defined and published by the NCP and measured against the corresponding NVIDIA severity level.

### Storage

The following service levels apply to NCP-provided storage.

- **Performance**: The NCP shall provision and sustain the contracted minimum performance.
  Performance below 85% of contracted targets sustained for 5 minutes or more constitutes an incident.
- **Availability**: 99.9%, measured per PB per month, defined as the fraction of time in which client mounts are healthy and no I/O request stalls beyond 60 seconds.
- **Durability**: 99.9999% per year against data loss or silent corruption, excluding tenant-initiated deletion.
  Data acknowledged as written must survive any single component failure.

### Managed Kubernetes Service

The definitions for the Managed Kubernetes Service elements are provided in the [Definitions](#definitions) section of this document.

The management service API must provide the following service levels.

- **Availability**: 99.95%, measured by the endpoint’s health status and ability to accept, durably store, and respond to the submitted requests.
- **Durability**: At least 99.999% of successfully acknowledged mutating service-management requests shall remain durably recorded and recoverable.
  Ensure that retrying such requests does not cause duplicate operations or unintended effects.
  Non-mutating requests need not be durably retained during service impairment.

The managed Kubernetes cluster control plane must provide the following service levels.

- **Availability**: 99.95% per managed cluster, measured by the API server endpoint’s health status and ability to accept, durably store, and respond to the submitted requests.
- **Durability**: At least 99.9% of successfully acknowledged mutating API requests.
  Idempotency must be guaranteed.

#### Managed Inference Endpoints (If Present)

Where offered, this SLA applies to each NCP-managed, tenant-facing production endpoint used to submit inference requests and receive model responses.
Management and control-plane APIs are covered separately.

- **Availability**: 99.9% per endpoint per calendar month, measured by the endpoint’s ability to accept and successfully complete conforming inference requests.

### Metering for Consumption Measurement

The following accuracy target applies to consumption metering.

- **Accuracy**: Within ±0.5% per month for shared or serverless capacity, and within ±0.1% per month for dedicated capacity.

### Telemetry

The following SLA applies to all required telemetry, measured from observation at the source until the record is available through the agreed ingestion interface.

- **Delivered Latency**: The NCP shall make at least 99.95% of required telemetry records (including metrics and logs) available within 120 seconds of observation at the source.

## Functional Requirements

This section describes the functional requirements across a wide range of domains.

### Compute and Network Provisioning

This section outlines the requirements for provisioning compute and network resources.

| **OIE02** | Severity Model | The NCP shall maintain a documented severity model for incidents and tickets, with a defined escalation path for each severity. The Service Levels section shall map the NCP severity levels to the applicable NVIDIA service targets. |
| **OIE03** | Incident Command | For each major incident, the NCP shall assign an incident commander, or an equivalent role, responsible for coordinating technical response, decisions, handoffs, and customer communications under a maintained major-incident playbook. |
| **OIE04** | Customer Notification | Customers shall be notified programmatically of qualifying, service-impacting incidents within the timeframe in the Service Levels section. |
| **OIE05** | Automated Fault Remediation | The NCP shall automatically detect faults. After detection, non-disruptive faults should be automatically remediated. Tenant-disruptive faults should be remediated in a directed manner that follows the defined maintenance processes. When a fault cannot be remediated programmatically, it should fall back to an NCP-managed manual flow. |
| **OIE06** | Root Cause and Corrective Action (RCCA) | For qualifying incidents, the NCP shall deliver a formal written RCCA report within a defined, published timeframe of at least monthly, stating specific corrective actions. |
| **OIE07** | Corrective-Action Tracking | Corrective actions shall be tracked to closure and target dates. Overdue actions shall be escalated and reviewed on a defined cadence. |

### Security Incident and Breach Notification

This section governs security incidents and confirmed or suspected compromise of NVIDIA tenancy, data, or infrastructure.
It complements the Security and Identity Management section, which defines the underlying controls.

The following table lists the security incident and breach notification requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OSB01** | Security Incident Handling | The NCP shall detect, contain, investigate, and remediate security incidents affecting customer tenancy, data, or infrastructure, under a defined security incident response capability. |
| **OSB02** | Breach Notification | The NCP shall notify tenants of any confirmed or reasonably suspected security breach, unauthorized access, or compromise of NVIDIA data or tenancy without undue delay, and with all available information. Notification shall occur no later than 24 hours for a high-severity or confirmed compromise, and no later than 72 hours for all other incidents. |
| **OSB03** | Evidence Preservation and Joint Investigation | The NCP shall preserve relevant logs and forensic evidence for the period required by applicable law or regulation, and for no less than 12 months. The NCP shall support joint investigation, including NVIDIA participation where agreed. |
| **OSB04** | Coordinated Disclosure | Public disclosure and external communications relating to an incident affecting the tenant shall be coordinated with the tenant. |
| **OSB05** | Security Post-Incident Report | Security incidents shall follow the RCCA process defined in OIE06, with any additional information about the scope of the compromise. |

### Service Health and Status Communications

The NCP must give NVIDIA an authoritative, always-available view of service health, active incidents, and planned maintenance.

The following table lists the service health and status communication requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OSH01** | Status Dashboard | An external health and status dashboard shall be published and available. The dashboard shall show health by region and by service, using clear multi-state indicators, for example, green, yellow, and red. |
| **OSH02** | Incident and Maintenance Posting | Active incidents and scheduled maintenance shall be posted to the dashboard in a timely manner. |
| **OSH03** | Historical Status | Historical uptime and incident history shall be retained and viewable. |
| **OSH04** | Programmatic Access | Status and health should be consumable programmatically for ingestion by the tenant. |

### Change and Release Management

Changes to production infrastructure must be controlled so that each change is approved, reversible, and communicated.
High-risk changes progress through a staged rollout.

The following table lists the change and release management requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OCR01** | Change Governance | The NCP shall employ a change control practice that ensures every change to production infrastructure is documented and approved before implementation and carries a rollback or back-out plan. Disruptive changes shall be communicated in advance, as described in the Fleet Health and Maintenance section. |
| **OCR02** | Emergency Change | The NCP may employ an emergency change path, distinct from standard change, with retrospective review aligned to the RCCA process. |
| **OCR03** | Progressive Delivery | Changes to NCP-managed platform or software services shall roll out with staged validation, defined stop criteria, blast-radius controls, and a tested rollback and recovery plan appropriate to the change. |
| **OCR04** | Change Observation | Following a change, a defined observation period shall elapse before the change is declared successful and closed. If an issue surfaces during this window, the changes shall be remediated and treated as a failed change rather than a new incident. |
| **OCR05** | Auditable Changes | Changes to production infrastructure supporting delivered services shall be versioned, reviewed, and auditable. Unauthorized or unreviewed deviations from the approved configuration shall be detected and remediated. |

### Fleet Health and Maintenance

Planned and emergency maintenance must be declared, scheduled with NVIDIA, and tracked.
A hand-back window is how long the tenant has to return the instance, and the maintenance window is how long the NCP has to perform the service.

The following table lists the fleet health and maintenance requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OFM01** | Declared Maintenance | Formal maintenance for instances in a maintenance-required or degraded mode shall be declared to the tenant through a defined process, with a hand-back window and a maintenance window provided. A hand-back window is expected to allow deferral for at least 2 weeks. |
| **OFM02** | Tenant Scheduling and Deferral | Tenants shall be able to schedule declared maintenance services through an API or console tools within the hand-back window. The NCP should not force eviction unless the window has expired. The tenant accepts the risk of continued use during the hand-back window. Maintenance should be non-disruptive where possible. Tenants should have the option to request a deferral, meaning an extension of the hand-back window. The NCP is not obligated to accept a deferral but may evaluate the request based on the criticality of the maintenance. |
| **OFM03** | Maintenance Tracking | Maintenance window open and close times shall be tracked, recorded, and exposed in scheduling APIs. An incident shall be declared when a window exceeds its planned close time. |
| **OFM04** | Emergency Maintenance | A defined path shall exist for declaring and executing emergency maintenance windows. This path allows the hand-back window to be very small, on the order of minutes. |
| **OFM05** | Validated Return | Following a declared or emergency maintenance event, such as a firmware upgrade or hardware replacement, the NCP shall complete all maintenance and validation across the affected compute, GPU, fabric, and storage resources before returning them to service. The validation is included in the maintenance window, whether the resources return to the tenant or to the allocable pool. |
| **OFM06** | Progressive Rollout | Firmware and OS changes shall be rolled out progressively, through an incremental deployment method, rather than fleet-wide at once. A failed partial deployment halts the rollout and is remediated. The tenant should be given the option to test and validate new firmware in a development cluster before it is rolled out to the tenant fleet. |
| **OFM07** | Sparing | The NCP shall define a spare parts and hot sparing strategy to support the availability SLA. |

### Operational Access and Activity Logging

The NCP operational access to production infrastructure must follow the security best practice of least privilege, be strongly authenticated, and be fully logged.
This section governs operator and provider access.
Tenant-facing identity and access management is defined in the Security and Identity Management section, and these requirements reference rather than restate it.

The following table lists the operational access and activity logging requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OAL01** | Operational Access Policy | Operator access to production infrastructure shall require multifactor authentication (MFA) and shall be restricted, through role-based and policy-based authorization, to the minimum permissions necessary to perform the operator’s assigned duties, as described in SEC07. |
| **OAL02** | Recertification and Offboarding | Access shall be recertified periodically and revoked on offboarding. |
| **OAL03** | Operational Activity Logging | All manual and administrative actions by NCP personnel affecting production infrastructure shall be included in the audit logs required by SEC08 and attributed to the authenticated operator and any assumed role. |
| **OAL04** | Log Monitoring | Operational activity logs shall be reviewed or monitored for anomalous activity. |
| **OAL05** | Two-Person Rule | High-risk operator actions on production infrastructure shall require two distinct authorized people, and no single operator can perform them alone. This shall be technically enforced and logged with both identities. A time-bounded break-glass exception may be used for emergency recovery, and its use must be logged and reported. |

### Vulnerability and Patch Management

The NCP must identify, prioritize, remediate, and, where relevant, disclose vulnerabilities across the infrastructure, and track them to closure.

The following table lists the vulnerability and patch management requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OVP01** | Vulnerability Management | The NCP shall identify, prioritize, remediate, and transparently disclose vulnerabilities and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the infrastructure. |
| **OVP02** | Scanning | Infrastructure shall be regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities and CVEs. |
| **OVP03** | Severity Prioritization | CVEs shall be prioritized by severity, for example, through a CVSS-based rating, with Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) receiving the highest prioritization. |
| **OVP04** | Remediation Targets | Remediation targets shall be defined by severity in the applicable service agreement, and critical vulnerabilities shall be remediated within those targets. |
| **OVP05** | Tracking to Closure | Remediation of vulnerabilities that affect delivered services or customer tenancy shall be tracked to closure with an accountable owner and target date. |
| **OVP06** | Exceptions | Exceptions and risk acceptances shall be formally documented and approved by an NVIDIA risk signatory. |

### Monitoring, Alerting, and On-Call

The NCP must monitor infrastructure and services, alert on defined conditions, and staff on-call to respond to alert notifications 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, independent of regional holidays and observances and of local and geographical events.
Telemetry content and delivery are defined in the Telemetry Requirements section, and this section defines the operational response layer.

The following table lists the monitoring, alerting, and on-call requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OMA01** | Monitoring | The NCP shall continuously monitor infrastructure and service health independent of tenant workloads, without requiring agents inside tenant workloads and without depending on tenant scheduler or application data. |
| **OMA02** | Alerting | Alerting shall use defined thresholds and route notifications to designated responders, with escalation for unacknowledged alerts. |
| **OMA03** | On-Call Coverage | On-call coverage shall respond to alert notifications, staffed under a 24x7x365 coverage model. |
| **OMA04** | Alert Tracking | Alert notification acknowledgement and response times shall be tracked. Reporting is needed only where SLAs or operational requirements require it. |
| **OMA05** | Retention for Investigation | Telemetry required to support investigations shall be retained for a period aligned to the retention defined in the Telemetry Requirements section. |

### Capacity and Availability Management

The NCP must plan capacity, measure availability against the published targets, and remedy misses.
Fleet inventory and health metrics are defined in the Capacity and Fleet Management section, the numeric targets in the Service Levels section, and the measurement mechanics in the next section.

The following table lists the capacity and availability management requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OCA01** | Capacity Planning | The NCP shall maintain a capacity planning process for GPU, compute, and supporting resources, with utilization monitored and forecast against available capacity. |
| **OCA02** | Availability Targets | Availability targets for all services shall be defined and published in the Service Levels section. Where a target is not specified by NVIDIA, the NCP proposes the applicable target and measurement method. |
| **OCA03** | Availability Measurement | Availability shall be measured and reported to the tenant against the published targets. |
| **OCA04** | SLA Remedies | An SLA credit or remedy process shall exist for missed targets, financially backed where specified. |
| **OCA05** | Metering Accuracy | Consumption metering used as the basis for capacity or billing shall meet the accuracy target published in the Service Levels section. |

### Service-Level Measurement and Definitions

Availability and other service-level targets are enforceable only if measurement is defined.
This section states how targets are measured, what is excluded, and how misses are reconciled, complementing the numeric targets in the Service Levels section.

The following table lists the service-level measurement requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OSL01** | Availability Exclusions | Scheduled maintenance does not count against availability for the declared affected resources and during the declared maintenance window. Required notice and tenant scheduling commitments must be met, the impact must not exceed the declared scope, and all maintenance, validation, and return-to-service work must complete by the declared close time. |
| **OSL02** | Measurement Source | Service-level measurement methodologies must be defined so that both the NCP and the tenant can compute the same result. |
| **OSL03** | Credit Mechanics | The mechanism for how SLA credits are calculated, claimed, and applied for missed targets shall be formally defined. |

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

This section defines disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity planning, backup verification, recovery objectives, and recovery testing for NCP-delivered services.

The following table lists the disaster recovery and business continuity requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **ODR01** | DR and BC Capability | The NCP shall maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans covering the services it delivers. |
| **ODR02** | Backups and Verification | Backups shall be performed and their restore integrity verified. |

| **ODR04** | DR Testing | DR and failover shall be tested on a defined cadence, with recorded results. |
| **ODR05** | DR Roles | Roles and responsibilities for DR execution shall be defined. |

### Provisioning and Onboarding

The NCP must run a defined lifecycle for standing up, scaling, and tearing down NVIDIA tenancy, including verifiable data deletion on exit.
New-capacity delivery timelines are defined in the Service Levels section, and capacity discovery is defined in the Capacity and Fleet Management section.

The following table lists the provisioning and onboarding requirements.

| Req ID | Requirement Area | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OPO01** | Onboarding and Provisioning | The NCP shall run a defined onboarding and provisioning process. |

## Appendix

This section contains links to reference documents and implementation guidance that provide additional details for NCPs.
Refer to [requirement level key words](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2119/) for the well-known definition of certain terms used in the document.

### Implementation Guidance

The following reference documents provide additional information on implementing some of the requirements in this guide.

1. Network topology discovery: [NVIDIA Topograph](https://github.com/NVIDIA/topograph).
   Aligning with this YAML format may be useful.
   Topograph currently provides in-cluster topology.
2. Exemplar Cloud: [NVIDIA Exemplar Cloud](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ai-cloud-performance/) and the [DGXC benchmarking repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dgxc-benchmarking/tree/v26.02).
3. Kubernetes security guidance: [Kubernetes Security Response Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/committee-security-response).

### Other Feature Considerations (Not Minimum Requirements)

The following capabilities are not minimum requirements, but NVIDIA considers them valuable additions.

1. **Disk cloning.** Disk-cloning capability for network-attached block devices.
   It should be possible to clone a disk even on a running instance.
2. **Managed control plane autoscaling.** Strong preference for the control plane to automatically add capacity when load increases.
3. **Threat detection.** Control planes, management planes, and hosts under the service provider control should deploy threat-detection and anomaly-detection solutions that can identify active threats, for example, a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) and a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS).
4. **Break-glass administrative access.** The platform should support a limited break-glass access mechanism for designated NVIDIA administrative users when federated SSO is unavailable, misconfigured, compromised, or otherwise prevents authorized access to the tenant.
   Break-glass accounts should use local platform credentials independent of the external identity provider, be explicitly excluded from SSO enforcement, and be protected by strong authentication controls including MFA.
   Their use should be auditable, generate security-relevant logs and alerts, and support periodic review, rotation, disablement, and testing.
